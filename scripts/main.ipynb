Affairs initially appear auspicious, but later on become perilous. If this line is drawn in divination, it is favorable for meeting with nobles and princes, but unfavorable for crossing waters or rivers.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "The \"Image\" commentary says: The upper trigram is Qian, which represents Heaven; the lower trigram is Kan, which represents Water. With Heaven and Water isolated and their flows opposing each other, the logic and circumstances are contradictory—this is the image of the Lawsuit Hexagram. A wise person observes this hexagram to understand the importance of avoiding litigation and thus must exercise extreme caution at the beginning of any undertaking.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (with Kan below and Qian above) stacked together. It is the opposite of the Xu hexagram and serves as its \"complementary hexagram.\" Qian signifies firmness and vigor, while Kan represents danger and entrapment. Firmness against danger, vigor against threat, naturally leads to disputes. Disputes are not favorable matters, and one must be cautious and fearful.\t\t\n",

      "### Step-by-Step Interpretation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Primary Hexagram: Coming to Meet (Gou)**\n",
      "    - This hexagram is associated with potential conflicts and encounters, suggesting careful navigation of matters that could involve disputes or entanglements.\n",
      "    - General advice here is to be cautious of imbalances and ensure careful preparation and timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Six Relatives Analysis:**\n",
      "    - Based on the description provided in line 3, we see the issue of relying on past support, which may indicate difficulty in progression or dealing with inheritance.\n",
      "    - Line 4 and line 5 suggest potential misfortune due to misalignment and sudden changes/disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Line Changes and Elements:**\n",
      "    - Noteworthy are the active transitions within the lines (i.e., the third line transitioning to 'Demons' indicating potential detrimental interference).\n",
      "    - Evaluate whether other positions create supportive or antagonistic relationships; in this case, the interactions present more hindrances than supports to the querent's objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Shi and Ying Line Dynamics:**\n",
      "    - The Shi (Self) line at position 5 (respective to 'Siblings') focuses on community and familial involvement, while Ying (Opponent) line at position 2 (directly oppositional) suggests seeking balance but facing inherent challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Overall Image:**\n",
      "    - With the broader indication of relational challenges, growing misalignments, and decline in Yang (strength), the interpretation suggests the fortuneteller should be cautionary in predictions regarding satisfaction in litigation outcomes. External factors (the yang lines, which generally denote blocking energies) may obstruct straightforward progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Seek Expert Counsel:** Given the complexities indicated by the hexagram, she should ensure she has competent legal representation to navigate potential pitfalls and complexities of the case.\n",

      "2. **Prepare Diligently:** Since the forecast suggests obstacles, she should thoroughly prepare all necessary documentation and evidence, possibly revisiting the case details to identify areas that may need extra attention.\n",

      "3. **Consider Mediation:** As conflicts are anticipated, exploring alternative dispute resolutions such as mediation might be beneficial. This aligns with the hexagram's caution about direct confrontations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stay Informed:** Keep updated on any changes or developments related to the case, as being prepared for sudden shifts can help mitigate negative impacts.\n",

      "5. **Avoid Rash Decisions:** The hexagram advises caution, so she should refrain from making hasty decisions that could complicate matters further.\n",

      "6. **Emotional Preparedness:** Given the potential for emotional and logistical challenges, maintaining a calm and level-headed approach will serve her best.\n",
      "\n",
      "### In Reflection:\n",
      "\n",
      "This hexagram serves as a gentle reminder that not all conflicts are easily resolved, and sometimes the journey itself requires patience and persistence. If the lawsuit presents ongoing difficulties, she might also need to evaluate the long-term aspects of the legal battle and its implications on her overall wellbeing.\n",

The generated answer accurately reflects this by stating, \"The fortune for the woman consulting about the lawsuit is not favorable.\" Thus, it scores 2 points.\n",

      "2. **Psychological preparation is needed (1 point):** The standard answer suggests the need for psychological readiness due to an unfavorable situation. The generated answer hints at this by advising her to \"be prepared for difficulties,\" which aligns with preparing psychologically. Hence, it deserves 1 point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **It is recommended to collect more evidence and strengthen the defense (2 points):** This is about the practical steps to improve one's standing in the lawsuit. The generated answer does not reference this practical step explicitly, so it gets 0 points in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stay calm and do not escalate conflicts (2 points):** The standard emphasizes maintaining composure and not escalating the situation. The generated answer does not advise specifically on staying calm or de-escalating, therefore receives 0 points for this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **If conditions improve, mediation can be attempted (1 point):** This point discusses future strategies if the circumstances are better. The generated answer does not cover the option of mediation or future improvement explicitly, hence it scores 0 points here.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Mention of external factors influencing the situation (2 points):** The standard answer recognizes situational elements that can impact the outcome. The generated answer acknowledges \"external factors might obstruct a straightforward resolution,\" which is an interpretation consistent with considering external influences, granting it 2 points.\n",
