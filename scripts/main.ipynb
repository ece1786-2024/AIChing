      "- Description: Hexagram Bo: It is unfavorable to undertake anything.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "The \"Xiangci\" (Commentary on the Image) says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The mountain rests on the earth, and wind and rain erode it; this is the image of the Bo hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, taking the warning from the falling of mountain rocks and the crumbling of cliff edges, thereby strengthening the unity and loyalty of the people, enabling them to live and work in peace and contentment.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of dissimilar trigrams (with Earth below and Mountain above). Five yin lines are below, with one yang line above, representing an abundance of yin and a solitary yang; a high mountain rests on the earth. Both signify the concept of peeling away, hence it is known as the \"Hexagram of Splitting Apart.\" In this hexagram, yin flourishes while yang declines, metaphorically indicating a time when petty people gain influence and virtuous people are in distress, leading to the ruin of enterprises.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Great Image: The mountain resting upon the earth symbolizes mountains and stones collapsing to the ground, with five yin lines pressuring one yang, causing justice to be damaged.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Fortunes: Misfortune surrounds you, suggesting the need to reorganize. Avoid being overconfident to prevent being implicated by women and petty individuals.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Career: The times are unfavorable and driven by great trends, meaning an individual can only adapt to situations and pause actions, observing changes without taking risks. It is essential to actively create conditions, build strength, and remain cautious and patient, avoiding collaboration with petty people. The turning of fortunes will inevitably lead to accomplishing goals in the near future.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Business: Having transitioned from a peak to a downturn entering a period of recession, it is essential to earnestly summarize experiences and lessons, implementing reorganizations, especially avoiding rash decisions. When favorable conditions arise, exploit them to smoothly and confidently reemerge.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Seeking Recognition: The likelihood of success is low, so persistent pursuit is inadvisable. Instead, continue to create opportunities, strive to improve oneself, and enhance social skills, strengthening capabilities to seize the chance for a comeback.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Marriage and Romance: Considerations must be thorough; unless a match is exceedingly suitable, do not proceed carelessly. Both parties should maintain family harmony.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Decision-Making: Life is fraught with twists, often leading to unfavorable or even dire circumstances. Yet, there is a chance for revival from dire situations. By calmly analyzing situations and struggling tenaciously, one will certainly transform their fate, achieving admirable outcomes that evoke envy in others. The key is to avoid hastily seeking success, and particularly avoiding taking risks. Adapt to the trends and guard against sabotage by petty individuals.\n",
      "- Scholar Interpretation: Exploitation and decay, the worry of disaster; advancement is difficult to achieve, stop in accordance with the times. For those who receive this hexagram, the time and fortune are not favorable, leading to many losses and obstacles to progress. It is advisable to stop in accordance with the times and maintain one’s duty. Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan: Fortune: The time and fortune are not favorable; maintain peace of mind and your place. Wealth: Profit from exports, exploiting others' wealth. Home: Do not leave your own home; buying a temporary residence is possible. Health: The soul is not attached, be extremely careful.\n",

Thunder resounding in the sky is the image of Da Zhuang. A noble person observes this image, recognizing the formidable speed of thunder and the strictness of propriety. Consequently, they have awe and respect, adhering solely to propriety.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (Qian below and Zhen above). Zhen signifies thunder; Qian signifies heaven. Qian is strong and Zhen moves. The sky roars with thunder, clouds roll, and the momentum is grand. Yang energy is abundant, and all things grow. The strength is robust, hence it is called powerful. Large and powerful, thus it is named Great Power. The four yang lines are vigorous, proactive, and effective. Both the upper and lower are just, with correct standards and upright shadows.\t\t\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      "The Commentary on the Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Xun, representing wind; the lower trigram is Kan, representing water. Wind moving over water is the image of the Dispersion hexagram. The ancient kings observed this hexagram and thus offered sacrifices to the Heavenly Emperor, established ancestral temples, and promoted the moral teachings of revering heaven and honoring ancestors.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram portrays the combination of different trigrams with Water below and Wind above. Wind moves swiftly over water, assisting its force and spreading in all directions. This hexagram, called Disperse, signifies the scattering of water, symbolizing the dispersion of organizations and human hearts. It must be overcome with active means and methods to defeat drawbacks, rescue dispersal, and turn danger into safety. \t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "The Great Image: Wind blows over the water, spreading and dispersing. It is also like the spring breeze that dissipates the severe cold, causing ice and snow to melt.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Fortunes: Although there are worries, difficulties can ultimately be resolved, and all endeavors will prosper. Avoid capriciousness and sluggishness.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Career: You are in a relatively difficult position, primarily due to a lack of unity. Strong measures must be taken to seek stability and unity.

      "\t\t\n",
      "Business: Market conditions are chaotic and directionless. Taking appropriate risks is absolutely necessary. One must be fair and selfless, restrain personal desires, and it is equally necessary to strive for powerful partners and support.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Pursuit of Fame: One must calm down, work hard to learn, and improve knowledge and skills. The situation of dispersal must be managed, requiring talent from various fields. The future is bright, with success depending crucially on individual effort.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Marriage and Relationships: As long as both parties hold pure intentions, success and happiness are inevitable.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Decision Making: To advance one's career, positive means must be employed to overcome and conquer the maladies of internal discord. One must first eliminate selfishness, sacrifice the lesser self for the greater self, and avoid getting involved in disputes. By doing so, a stable situation can be regained, and in a favorable environment, the prospect of every undertaking is bright.\n",
      "- Scholar Interpretation: Dissolution dissipates disasters; seize the opportunity to observe changes and cultivate strength while preserving energy. For those who receive this hexagram, there may initially be difficulties, but ultimately problems can be resolved. It is advisable to be cautious in all matters to achieve success, and avoid reckless indulgence. \t\t\n",

      "\n",
      "<analyze> \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example 1: Hexagram \"Splitting Apart\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identifying the Primary Hexagram**: \"Splitting Apart\" is known as Bo, indicative of unfavorable conditions and suggesting a time when yin dominates over yang.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Analyzing the Scholar Interpretation**: The goal is to understand the obstruction and challenges due to prevailing yin influences. The scholar's advice emphasizes caution, not directly seeking advancement during unfavorable times, but attempting to comply with the current pace and prepare for opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Line Analysis**: The third line change introduces a transition, focusing on fame and profit, advising retreat to prevent further trouble as continuation without adaptation leads to misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: There’s a focus on unfavorable undertakings due to pressure on yang by yin energies, but a potential future improvement after caution and preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example 2: Hexagram \"The Power of the Great\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identifying the Primary Hexagram**: \"The Power of the Great\" indicates a peak of fortune, suggesting strong, positive forces but caution against overextension.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Analyzing the Scholar Interpretation**: While fortune is strong, remaining humble and utilizing wisdom rather than mere strength is advised. Like academic endeavors, exercising patience and not rushing can prevent backfiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Line Analysis**: Changes in the second line emphasize mental clarity and strategy over pure power, which can contribute to a successful resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Even in peak conditions, caution to not overreach is vital, with a balanced approach bringing favorable resolutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "</analyze>\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's apply this methodology to interpret your hexagram:\n",
      "\n",
      "<reason>\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identifying the Primary Hexagram**: The hexagram obtained for your question is \"Dispersion,\" which symbolizes the dispersal and the resolution of concerns. The image suggests methods to overcome disunity and achieve success through proper strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scholar Interpretation and Symbolic Meaning**: As interpreted, though facing challenges like dispersal akin to educational struggles, it implies thriving by overcoming these through careful planning, suggesting favorable conditions upon rectifying inner discord or confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Line Analysis and Element Interactions**:\n",
      "   - **Line 1** indicates a hasty, temporary escape from trouble; accurate in academics as quick adjustments may avoid failure.\n",
      "   - **Line 2** suggests minor issues won't lead to long-term harm, implying academic upsets experienced will not derail overall success.\n",
      "   - **Line 5 (Changed Line)** transformation from \"Demons\" in water element to \"Dead\" indicates a shift from external to internal practices, such as self-discipline and thoughtful preparations, leading to profitable or peaceful outcomes, aligning well with an academic focus.\n",
      "   - **Line 6 (Changed Line)** reinforces ultimate resolution and security after necessary precautions in endeavors, paralleling academic diligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hexagram Transition**:\n",
      "   - The movement from dispersion to provision of higher status (Sixth Line changes to positive recognition) may suggest that with focused effort, academic pursuits will yield favorable recognition and success.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Shi and Ying Analysis**: The Shi line of Parents and Ying line of Children both show interactions involving motivations and challenges in academic advancement. Parents as shi indicates a supporting root of knowledge and tradition, while Children as Ying inspects the progress and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Interpretation**: Your hexagram suggests an initial period of disarray or lack of direction in academic pursuits due to a scattering of focus. However, through disciplined, strategic efforts and unified purpose, not only can it lead to overcoming initial hurdles, but it can also open the way for notable success.\n",
