## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (P«ê) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.		
		
Career: The situation is adverse, the career is in a declining phase, with many difficulties. There is interference from antagonistic people leading to frustration and many setbacks. One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.		
		
Home and dwelling: be diligent and frugal to avoid disaster; there is an indication of separation. 		
		
Health: the flow of vital energy and blood is obstructed, moderation in diet is advised.

Hexagram_Interpreter: 
To understand the hexagram and its elements, let's analyze step by step:

<analyze>
**Example 1 Analysis:**

1. **Hexagram Overview**:
   - The hexagram is "Fellowship with Others," which generally signifies harmonious relationships and the benefits of group endeavors.
   - The essence of this hexagram is about unity and collaboration. The auspicious nature indicates the possibility of a favorable outcome when people work together.
   
2. **Line Analysis**:
   - Line 4, being a changed line, is significant. The transformation suggests a shift towards harmony, as reflected by the post-change interpretation: a harmonious family.
   
3. **Element and Spirits**:
   - Line 4 (initial state: ren wu fire) indicates siblings' relation, and the changing element (xin wei soil) symbolizes children. The transformation signifies a shift to a stable state (soil element).
   
4. **Cyclic Interaction**:
   - The interaction here does not strongly indicate an immediate time frame. However, considering the potential harmonic interactions, a positive reconciliation or gathering is feasible.
   
5. **Date Correlation**:
   - The month of Shen was noted within the analysis, suggesting a timeframe for potential return.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

1. **Hexagram Overview**:
   - The hexagram "Stanstill (Stagnation)" identifies a state of obstruction, depicting difficulties and delays rather than progress.
   
2. **Line Analysis**:
   - Line 1 and Line 3 changed, indicating movement, albeit within the context of a challenging overall hexagram.
   - Despite this, changes reflect the potential for new beginnings after overcoming obstacles.
   
3. **Element and Spirits**:
   - Line 3 (initial state: yi mao wood; post-change: ji hai water) implies relation to children, suggesting reliance or nurturing.
   - The delays suggested by shifted elements (now water) propose emotional engagements and the need to flow with current predicaments.
   
4. **Cyclic Interaction**:
   - The elemental analysis indicates a need to wait for the right conditions or support to be available, reinforcing delay.
   
5. **Date Correlation**:
   - Influence noted was more on patient waiting and resilience than specific times, but the notations on feelings of anxiety highlight the need for grounding actions.

**Summarizing Examples:**
- Example 1 leans positively towards reunion, utilizing harmonious unity aspects and specific dates (month of Shen noted).
- Example 2 presents difficulties with changed aspects offering potential hope after patients and alignment with elemental flow.
</analyze> 

Now, let's employ these strategies to your hexagram, "Fellowship with others," in answering your question about when the loved one will return:

<reason>
1. **Hexagram Overview**:
   - "Fellowship with others" suggests gathering and harmonious interaction, hinting that the return involves unity and support.

2. **Line Interaction**:
   - The prominent line to consider is Line 5, which transitioned from a challenging state to post-disaster weeping and laughter (connected to overcoming difficulties).
   - This change reflects hope and positive eventual reunion after enduring struggle.

3. **Elemental and Spiritual Interaction**:
   - Line 5 transitions from ren shen gold (indicating wife and wealth elements) to ji wei soil (children). This implies a shift towards stability, reconciliations, and resolution.

4. **Cyclic Interaction and Timing**:
   - The interaction and transition from metal (transformative challenge, strength) to earth (stability, nurturing) suggest an incremental transition towards solace and safety, not indicating imminent, but assured return over time.
   - Harmonious unity coupled with insights from earth elements leads toward eventual fulfillment connected intimately to personal connections and familial strength.

5. **Final Insights**:
   - Given the characteristic nature, Line 5 is key for its significant change potentially signifying a relief after distress. While a specific date (like a month) is not overtly indicated, steady progress from struggle to joy embodies hope and continued waiting for the right conditions.

The interpretation suggests you maintain a spirit of unity and perseverance while expecting the return. Changes from adversity to prosperity hint at eventual resolution and return.
</reason> 

Focusing on stability and observing connections will enhance understanding of potential timing. Remember, patience and unity under this hexagram signify significant alignments for upcoming positive outcomes.
