        Hello, masters. I came here to ask for my fortune.
        First, please allow me to provide you some examples.
        



# Example 1

## Question: Is it possible to reconcile with family?




# 

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Family

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Family: Inquiring about matters concerning women is auspicious.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which represents wind; the inner trigram is Li, representing fire. Internally, fire; externally, wind. Wind assists the fire's strength, and fire enhances the wind's power, complementing each other—this is the image of Family. Observing this hexagram, the noble person realizes that words must have substance to avoid emptiness, and virtues must be sustained continuously to be abundant.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Xun above) stacked. Li represents fire; Xun represents wind. Fire causes heat to rise and become wind. All things should begin with an inner foundation before extending outward. Occurrences originate internally and form externally, symbolizing the idea of governing the household first before governing the realm. When the household is righteous, the world is peaceful and happy.		
		
Great Image: The image of wind blowing on fire, enhancing the power of fire, symbolizes family members working together with a united effort to develop their enterprise.		
		
Fortune: Great peace and good fortune, cooperation with others is easily successful, and there are signs of celebration, such as having children or marriages.		
		
Career: Success depends on the condition of the household. Strictly managing the household to prevent unexpected incidents "starting from the backyard" is the prerequisite for career success. When husband and wife live in harmony and cooperate, they can escape poverty and become prosperous. Careers should progress from within to the outside, step by step, with persistence, leading to eventual success.		
		
Business: Apply household management methods to commercial activities. In dealing with company employees, a combination of strictness and leniency is required, with an emphasis on strictness. It is advisable to concentrate leadership under one person who manages, with collective cooperation, accumulating over time.		
		
Seeking Fame: Rely on hard work, enduring poverty happily, and more importantly, the support of family. As the family flourishes, personal success in career endeavors becomes easier.		
		
Marriage: A harmonious family is the foundation of everything, and the wife is the root of the family. Choosing a wife should be done with caution to bring harmony and prosperity to the family.		
		
Decision Making: Success comes smoothly due to the support of a good family and wife, and it is essential to maintain this advantage. Otherwise, prosperity can quickly turn into decline. It is especially important to guard against family upheaval. Managing the household relies on treating others with humility and frugality, accumulating wealth. Family members should be harmonious and friendly with one another.
- Scholar Interpretation: When the heart is directed inward, the household prospers; being strict and consistent cannot sway the heart. Those who receive this hexagram will find it advantageous to collaborate with others, and there are many signs of joyful events. Families in harmony can work together with a united heart to develop their endeavors. 		
		
Famed Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is at its peak, but be cautious with words and actions.		
Wealth: Accumulate goods, as they will later be sold at high prices.		
Home: Be wary of fires; strengthen family ties.		
Health: Excessive phlegm and asthma are difficult to cure.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Pushing Upward

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Ascending: Extremely prosperous, beneficial for meeting with kings and nobility, without worries. If obtaining this line in divination, it is auspicious to embark on an expedition to the south.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Earth, which represents the earth; the inner trigram is Wind, which represents wood. This suggests the image of wood growing in the earth, which is the symbol of the Ascending hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, thus adhering to virtue and righteousness, enhancing self-cultivation, starting from small beginnings, and gradually nurturing lofty character.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram represents the overlapping of different trigrams (with Xùn below and Kūn above). Kūn symbolizes Earth and obedience, while Xùn symbolizes wood and humility. The Earth nurtures and grows trees, allowing them to gradually mature and flourish, symbolizing a career that progresses step by step towards great prospects, hence the name "Ascend."

Romance: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity and gradually nurture their affection, leading to certain success.		
		
Decision-making: Wishes will come true. Be smart and flexible, with a good foundation for success. Strictly discipline yourself, remain humble and obedient, earnestly seek advice from elders, and steadily and gradually develop your career. Like the growth of trees, you will eventually become a pillar of strength. However, in the growth process, caution is necessary at every step, maintaining sincerity and integrity, and advancing boldly.
- Scholar Interpretation: Rising and advancing, smoothly pursuing one's ambitions; emerging from darkness to brightness, gradually ascending and progressing. Those who receive this hexagram will find their fortunes rising, with all matters developing positively and successfully, achieving both fame and fortune.		
		
Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
Fortunes: As spring returns to the earth, one rises higher each day.		
Wealth: Save and accumulate wealth; one can become wealthy.		
Household: Renovate the mansion; elevate the status of a concubine.		
Health: Liver fire gradually increases; take care to nourish oneself early.

**Here's my question: A woman asks if she should express to her boyfriend the desire to reconcile.**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step how the example hexagrams are interpreted:

<analyze>
**Example 1: Reconciliation with Family**

1. **Hexagram Overview**: The primary hexagram is "The Family," which deals with family dynamics and the significance of harmonious household management.

2. **Elemental and Relational Analysis**: The primary focus is on the Sibling line, which is flourishing, and the Self line, supported by the moon. This represents strong interpersonal connections and the potential for reconciliation within the family.

3. **Analysis of the Changing Lines**: Specific line changes aren't highlighted in the interpretation, which suggests the emphasis is more on the overall dynamic as indicated by the flourishing Sibling line.

4. **Interpretation Outcome**: The interpretation suggests that emotions among family members can gradually be repaired, implying a potential positive reconciliation.

**Example 2: Reconciliation with Relatives**

1. **Hexagram Overview**: Like before, the hexagram is "The Family," indicating a focus on familial or close relationships.

2. **Elemental and Relational Analysis**: Here, it's the Sibling line that is active and flourishing, indicating there may be communication obstacles in family relationships.

3. **Analysis of the Changing Lines**: The transformation suggests that reconciliation needs mutual understanding and patience.

4. **Interpretation Outcome**: The interpretation concludes that reconciliation requires mutual efforts and patience due to the static nature and subsequent retreat indicated in the hexagram development.
</analyze>

**Your Hexagram: Pushing Upward**

1. **Hexagram Overview**: The primary hexagram is "Pushing Upward," symbolizing gradual progress and ascension from humble beginnings towards fulfillment and growth. This suggests an upward trajectory in terms of personal development and relationships.

2. **Elemental and Relational Analysis**: 
   - The interactions between the elements (Earth and Wind/Wood) indicate a supportive relationship: the Earth nurtures growth, symbolizing progress and expansion.
   - The Six Relatives outline relationships between elements, providing an idea of what influences are present in the situation. Here, different elements such as Water (associated with Parents) and Soil (Wife/Wealth) interact revealing the dynamics surrounding the question.

3. **Lines and Transformations Analysis**:
   - **Line 4's Transformation**: The change from "sacrificial ceremony" to "in hunting, nothing is caught" implies a challenge in the current course that might require reassessment or flexibility.
   - **Other Lines**: Each line's meaning promotes gradual development and finding one's path, referencing self-development, suggesting that a steady, considered approach will be favorable.

<reason>
Regarding the woman's question, should she express the desire to reconcile with her boyfriend:

1. **Supportive Environment**: The overall attributes of the hexagram suggest an environment conducive to growth and elevation. Mutual nurturing and gradual steps towards expressing feelings can lead to prosperous outcomes.

2. **Elemental Strengths**: The Earth nurturing Wood alongside Water elements suggests support from foundational (home/family) elements, meaning the situation is rooted in strong, established relationships, conducive to reconnection.

3. **Implication of Line Changes**: The change in Line 4 warns of potential unmet expectations or challenges, suggesting that expressing the desire to reconcile should be done thoughtfully and cautiously to ensure a mutual understanding is sought.

4. **Strings of Advice**: Aligning with virtues of caution and gradual progress while focusing on sincere, honest communication aligns with the advice of progressing carefully.

In conclusion, the exploration indicates that while expressing the desire to reconcile may be positive if done wisely, acknowledging potential blocks and nurturing the connection through genuine efforts can lead to successful reconciliation. Therefore, it is in her best interest to carefully weigh the timing and approach, ensuring that her intentions are sincere and grounded. This acknowledges both the promise of progress (as depicted by "Pushing Upward") and the necessity to plan thoughtfully around any obstacles.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Expressing the desire to reconcile with your boyfriend appears positive, provided it's done thoughtfully and sincerely. The hexagram "Pushing Upward" suggests a favorable environment for gradual progress and reconnection. Approach the situation with care, recognizing potential challenges and ensuring open, genuine communication. This nurturing approach aligns with growth and mutual understanding, increasing the likelihood of a successful reconciliation.

Standard Answer: This hexagram can be viewed from two perspectives: the Demons are excessively strong, and the sole entry into the tomb is also a basis for this, so the possibility of the two people reconciling is very small.
