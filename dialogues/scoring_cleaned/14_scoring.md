To evaluate the generated answer, let's first break down the standard answer into its key points and assign scores based on their importance:

1. Hexagram indicates no obvious support from the wealth line - 3 points
2. 'Useful god' being overcome and conflicted, making it difficult to succeed - 5 points

Now, I'll evaluate the generated answer based on these key points and relevance.

Relevance$2$1

**Explanation:**

1. **Hexagram indicates no obvious support from the wealth line (3 points):** 
   - This is a crucial detail because it outlines the hexagram's implication for financial aid or backing. The generated response contradicts this by suggesting potential external support or resources, which directly opposes the standard answer. Thus, 0 points are awarded.

2. **'Useful god' being overcome and conflicted, making it difficult to succeed (5 points):**
   - This is another critical point, emphasizing intrinsic obstacles or challenges. The generated answer does not address internal conflict and instead promotes a narrative encouraging potential success through transparency and loyalty, earning 1 point as it tangentially relates to the theme of necessary actions for overcoming difficulties without acknowledging internal obstacles.

3. **Relevance (2 points):**
   - The generated answer relates to the question by addressing the outcome of a bid through the hexagram interpretation. Though it diverges considerably in interpretation compared to the standard, it remains partially relevant to the nature of the query. Hence, it receives 1 point.
