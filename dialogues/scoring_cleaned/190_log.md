## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Clinging Fire

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Li: Auspicious divination, smooth advancement. Raising a cow, favorable.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The sun rises today, the sun rises tomorrow, continually without pause; this is the image of the Li hexagram. Nobles and princes observe this hexagram image and thereby bring continuous brightness to illuminate all around.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of the same trigram repeated, with lower Li and upper Li. Li symbolizes attachment, representing the idea of attaching itself, with a single yielding line adhering to two solid lines above and below. The hexagram symbolizes fire, with emptiness inside and brightness outside. Li represents fire and brightness, with the sun rising and setting repeatedly, moving ceaselessly, with gentleness at heart.		
		
Great Image: Two fires overlap, symbolizing being connected from top to bottom with clarity, representing the idea of fire having energy but lacking form, indicating inconstancy and unreliability.		
		
Prospects: Outwardly very prosperous, resembling the sun at its zenith, but it is inadvisable to rush into things or act impulsively.		
		
Career: Approaching the pinnacle, with prosperity reaching decline; it is essential to summarize experiences and lessons, pursue good and avoid evil, nurture oneself with the flow, be aware of dangers while in danger, inspire willpower, and refrain from reckless actions. It is especially important to seek the assistance of people who are upright and strive to revitalize one's career.		
		
Business: Avoid being overly eager for success; proceed with caution, be deeply considerate and far-sighted, study market trends, engage in fair competition, avoid speculation and cunning, and strive for close cooperation with others.		
		
Fame Seeking: Before the direction is determined, do not act rashly in all directions, be persistent, pursue resolutely, and humbly seek guidance from virtuous and talented elders.		
		
Marriage and Romance: It might be difficult to find a suitable partner on your own, so it's best to enlist the help of reliable friends and elders, and do not be impatient. Both parties should respect each other, and it's most important to avoid having improper thoughts.		
		
Decision Making: Be cheerful and accept fate, conform to nature. In youth, rushing for progress might not realize one's ideals; however, by adhering to fairness and humility, one can be without misfortunes, and by remaining alert, can turn danger into safety. In times of crisis, seek support, but be cautious in selecting whom to rely on. In later years, understand one's destiny and avoid rash actions that disregard the situation.
- Scholar Interpretation: Attach to brightness, advance with humility and caution; be just and gentle, conform accordingly and thus find fortune.		
		
Those who receive this hexagram should be modest and careful, advancing steadily, and their future will be bright. Those who advance hastily or act impulsively will inevitably incur losses.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's renowned scholar Fu Pei-Rong:		
		
Fortune: Diligently cultivate virtue, and the future will be bright.		
		
Wealth: Anything related to fire will yield gains.		
		
Home: A house of nobility; can acquire a second spouse.		
		
Body: Severe heat-related illness, be cautious to avoid major loss.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Family

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Family: Inquiring about matters concerning women is auspicious.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which represents wind; the inner trigram is Li, representing fire. Internally, fire; externally, wind. Wind assists the fire's strength, and fire enhances the wind's power, complementing each otherâ€”this is the image of Family. Observing this hexagram, the noble person realizes that words must have substance to avoid emptiness, and virtues must be sustained continuously to be abundant.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Xun above) stacked. Li represents fire; Xun represents wind. Fire causes heat to rise and become wind. All things should begin with an inner foundation before extending outward. Occurrences originate internally and form externally, symbolizing the idea of governing the household first before governing the realm. When the household is righteous, the world is peaceful and happy.		
		
Great Image: The image of wind blowing on fire, enhancing the power of fire, symbolizes family members working together with a united effort to develop their enterprise.		
		
Fortune: Great peace and good fortune, cooperation with others is easily successful, and there are signs of celebration, such as having children or marriages.		
		
Career: Success depends on the condition of the household. Strictly managing the household to prevent unexpected incidents "starting from the backyard" is the prerequisite for career success. When husband and wife live in harmony and cooperate, they can escape poverty and become prosperous. Careers should progress from within to the outside, step by step, with persistence, leading to eventual success.		
		
Business: Apply household management methods to commercial activities. In dealing with company employees, a combination of strictness and leniency is required, with an emphasis on strictness. It is advisable to concentrate leadership under one person who manages, with collective cooperation, accumulating over time.		
		
Seeking Fame: Rely on hard work, enduring poverty happily, and more importantly, the support of family. As the family flourishes, personal success in career endeavors becomes easier.		
		
Marriage: A harmonious family is the foundation of everything, and the wife is the root of the family. Choosing a wife should be done with caution to bring harmony and prosperity to the family.		
		
Decision Making: Success comes smoothly due to the support of a good family and wife, and it is essential to maintain this advantage. Otherwise, prosperity can quickly turn into decline. It is especially important to guard against family upheaval. Managing the household relies on treating others with humility and frugality, accumulating wealth. Family members should be harmonious and friendly with one another.
- Scholar Interpretation: When the heart is directed inward, the household prospers; being strict and consistent cannot sway the heart. Those who receive this hexagram will find it advantageous to collaborate with others, and there are many signs of joyful events. Families in harmony can work together with a united heart to develop their endeavors. 		
		
Famed Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is at its peak, but be cautious with words and actions.		
Wealth: Accumulate goods, as they will later be sold at high prices.		
Home: Be wary of fires; strengthen family ties.		
Health: Excessive phlegm and asthma are difficult to cure.

However, through diligent labor, one can escape poverty and achieve prosperity. In a household of wealth and honor, indulgence in luxury leads the wife and children to only know laughter and merriment, ultimately leading to downfall. The commentary says: In a household of poverty, if one can work diligently, they maintain upright family values. In a tomb of wealth and honor, if one focuses solely on laughter and merriment, they stray from the path of diligence and frugality.

    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:

    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Top six: Straying from the path and finding it difficult to return, there is danger and misfortune.

The commentary says: The difficulty in returning and encountering danger is because the ruler has violated the principles of rulership.
        - Element: gui you gold, Relation: Demons

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The line representing Children is strong and transforms into retreat, indicating that there are certain challenges in the examination, but effort can lead to success. The self line is supported by the line representing Wife and Wealth, showing that the seeker has a substantial hope of passing smoothly.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Innocence

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Wu Wang: Favorable and unobstructed, divination reveals auspicious signs. If actions are improper, there will be misfortune and harm, and endeavors will be unfavorable. 		
		
The "Image" commentary says: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, while the lower trigram is Zhen, representing Thunder. Beneath the heavens, the spring thunder rolls, all things sprout and flourish, multiplying and reproducing â€” this is the image of Wu Wang. The ancient kings observed this hexagram, thereby inspiring themselves to strive with diligence, comply with the seasons, and nurture all things.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram involves the overlay of different trigrams: Zhen below and Qian above. Qian represents the heavens, firmness, and vigor; Zhen stands for thunder, firmness, and movement. When movement is vigorous, firm, and positive, the spirit is uplifted, leading inevitably to attainment, but only by following the path of purity and truth. Without falsehood, success will come, and blessings will follow.		
		
The Great Image: Thunder moves in the sky, and the masculine energy spreads out, symbolizing truthfulness without falseness.		
		
Fortune: In all pursuits, it is advisable to maintain integrity. Those whose actions lack proper conduct will surely invite disaster.		
		
Career: It is valuable to have self-awareness and to start from one's actual circumstances without harboring unrealistic expectations. By being grounded, diligent, and careful in one's conduct, unexpected misfortunes can be avoided. Focus on the process rather than the outcome, pursue sincerely, act when the timing is right, and success in one's career will follow.		
		
Business: Avoid forcing things that are difficult. Adhere to market rules, uphold business ethics, avoid speculative mentality, and reject the pursuit of excessive profits. Through hard work and gradual accumulation, success is assured.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With good motivations and diligent effort, discard illusions, focus on the labor rather than the harvest, and inevitably there will be gains.		
		
Marriage and Love: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity, and must not take a hasty attitude. It is also inappropriate to rush into anything; let things develop naturallyâ€”a culmination will be reached when conditions are ripe.		
		
Decision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Do not deceive, do not speak falsely, be genuine and sincere; conform to nature, and blessings and prosperity will be profound and extensive. Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home's fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family. Health: Maintain exercise, and digestion will occur naturally.
