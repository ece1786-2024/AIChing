## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Contemplation

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Guan: During sacrificial rituals, wine is poured to invite spirits without offering human sacrifices, because the heads of captives used for sacrifice are swollen and cannot be used as offerings. The Xiangci states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Xun, which represents wind, and the lower trigram is Kun, which represents earth. The wind moves across the earth, blowing over all things; this is the image of Guan. The ancient kings observed this hexagram image and took the wind that circulates in all directions as a model, thereby patrolling the states, observing the people's conditions, and promoting enlightenment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacking, with wind moving on the earth, symbolizing the widespread teaching of virtue. The Observing and the Approaching hexagrams form complementary pairs for mutual use. Those in higher status contemplate the world with morality and justice, while those below look up with reverence, leading to submission of hearts.		
		
The Image: The wind moves above the earth, implying a meaning of traveling and sightseeing. Yin prevails as Yang diminishes, the righteous path weakens, and all things struggle to proceed.		
		
Fortune: Being in the midst of change, it is advisable to observe meticulously, as one may experience distress both mentally and physically, and must guard against external temptations.		
		
Career: Signs of adversity have appeared in one's career, necessitating humility and caution. One should have foresight and avoid short-term actions, remain open-minded, and focus on good interpersonal relationships, uniting with others, and not acting rashly. When necessary, it is not inappropriate to seek assistance from virtuous individuals to seek further development.		
		
Business: The market situation is unstable and in a state of flux, requiring caution and careful observation of trends, planning for the long term, and being prepared for retreat if needed.		
		
Reputation: It is important to have self-knowledge, modestly seek guidance from others, correct one's attitude towards life, and avoid self-satisfaction. Moreover, one must adhere to integrity and establish grand ideals without losing personal goals or deviating from the righteous path.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Unfavorable; both parties should withstand tests, plan for the long term, leading to an ideal outcome.		
		
Decision-making: Possessing organizational ability makes one suitable for responsible work, but life's journey involves many twists. It is crucial to cultivate foresight and observance, handling matters impartially and realistically, paying attention to human dynamics, and caring for others. Especially avoid falling into the paths of petty people or shortsighted behaviors. One should exhibit a resolute spirit, not follow blindly, and if necessary, employ strategic dependency.
- Scholar Interpretation: Observing below while viewing above, traveling and inspecting; maintaining calmness and composure, remain steadfast at your post. One who receives this hexagram finds themselves amidst change, with unsettled mind and spirit. It is advisable to observe keenly, act when the opportunity arises, and refrain from rash advancement. Fu Peirong, a renowned scholar in Taiwanese Sinology, interprets as follows: Fortune: Travel outside; it is not easy to stay idle at home. Wealth: Selling foreign goods, be cautious of risks. Residence: Worship gods and Buddhas. Health: Rheumatic conditions, exercise and nurture.

**Here's my question: Will friends fulfill their promises?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

- **Hexagram Information and Interpretation:** In Example 1, the primary hexagram is "The Arousing (Shock)." The hexagram information outlines different elements and relational lines: Parents, Sibling, Wife and Wealth, with spirits such as White Tiger and Azure Dragon. Interpretation focuses on active lines and interactions. The Sibling line is prosperous, clashing with Wealth, indicating disagreements in the cooperation. However, of interest is how the querent (clearly identified here as Self) is supported by the Wealth line.

- **Methodology:** Interpretation is done by looking at the interactions between relational lines and the elemental attributes of each line. Prosperity and activity of lines indicate influences like disagreements or hopes for collaboration. Linking these observations back to the original question identifies potential outcomes based on cooperative dynamics among friends.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

- **Hexagram Information and Interpretation:** This example uses the "Approach" hexagram to question the timely repayment of a loan. The interpretive focus here is on the Wife and Wealth and Self lines, as they indicate intentions of repayment and the prosactiveness needed from the querent.

- **Methodology:** Here, the static position of Wealth lines indicates a slow process but positive intention, while Self's prosperity suggests necessary proactive social interaction. Interpreters keenly observe the determined dynamic between lines that symbolize participantsâ€™ responsibilities towards the question asked.

**<analyze> <analyze>**

Now, let's interpret this hexagram using the same methodology:

**Hexagram Analysis:**

Primary Hexagram: "Contemplation" (Guan)

1. **Description:** The symbolism indicates the necessity of observation, reflection, and considering external conditions. It advises meticulous assessment and vigilant consultation before making decisions. Cautionary attributes suggest potential disruption but promise insight if the right perspective is maintained.

2. **Line Analysis:** 

   - **Line 1 (Parents):** Its description aligns with the foolishness of common people only leading to significant issues when responsibilities like friendship or commitments are concerned.
   
   - **Line 2 (Demons):** As it has changed, the hunting and capture narrative of this line suggests overcoming obstacles and potential rewards from precise observations.
   
   - **Line 4 (Parents):** This changing line describes sentiments of caution over achievements and warns against complacency.
   
   - **Line 5 (Demons):** Shows personal observation leading to auspicious outcomes, hinting at correct interpretation or perspective over the promises.
   
   - **Line 6 (Wife and Wealth):** Indicates the undecisive yet observant approach where trust in intentions might lead to favorable outcomes only if observed and guided correctly.

3. **Five Elements Interaction:** The hexagrams reveal interplays between Parent and Demon lines, suggesting tensions between established systems or expectations (parents) and internal/external disruptive elements (demons). A cautious approach, observation, and wisdom improve outcomes related to the specific context.

4. **Six Relatives Interaction:** Notably, the Wife and Wealth line's static position could suggest an inconsistency or fluidity regarding the potential to fulfill promises, underlined by the effects seen in changing lines calling for strategic and insightful engagement.

5. **Six Spirits Influence:** Interpretation is further nuanced by the line's associated spirits emphasizing protective presence, vigilance over surrounding motives, and persistent evaluation.

**<reason> <reason>**

Following the methodology, here's the reasoning:

Incorporating the Observing Hexagram (Contemplation/Guan), which strongly emphasizes the need to watch, learn, and act thoughtfully, one understands that the dynamics of friendships and promises here must face trials of observation and understanding. Particularly active and passive elements describe how immediate actions or confirmations might not follow the anticipated course, necessitating continual engagement and verification.

Active lines advocate for patience, highlighting that the tendency for "Demons" to create discord can be mitigated by keen observation, with relational impacts strengthening ties. "Parents" and "Wife and Wealth" signify structural and economic exchanges, while the overarching framework provided by the hexagram designates potential fulfillment of promises through careful systemic observation, fostering trust, and skillfully maneuvering relationships.

Finally, this interpretation concludes that, although some lines forecast cautiousness and potential slow fulfillment of promises, understanding friend relations pragmatically and empathetically aligns to support assurances.

**<reason> <reason>**
Rational_Agent: 
Your question about whether friends will fulfill their promises aligns with the hexagram "Contemplation." This hexagram indicates the need for vigilant observation and understanding of the dynamics at play. While promises may not be immediately fulfilled, a careful evaluation and continued engagement with your friends will guide the situation toward a positive resolution. Trust and patience are key, as analyzing intentions and maintaining open communication will lead to the fulfillment of promises eventually. Be proactive in offering support and guidance, ensuring all parties are aligned in their expectations.

Standard Answer: Feedback from friends regarding delayed fulfillment of promises, but ultimately completed as promised. (From the collection of well-known hexagram examples 47)
