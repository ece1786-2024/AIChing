## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Well

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of the Well: To change the settlements without changing the water well is equivalent to doing nothing. People come and go by the well to draw water, and if the well becomes dry and silted without being cleaned, and instead, the water jar is broken—this is an omen of danger.		
		
The "Image" says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which symbolizes wood; the upper trigram is Kan, which symbolizes water. Water seeps downward and trees grow upward; this is the imagery of the Well hexagram. The noble person observes this image, takes inspiration from how well water nourishes people, and thus encourages the people to be diligent and to mutually encourage one another.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the stacking of different trigrams, with the lower being Xun and the upper being Kan. Kan represents water; Xun represents wood. Trees thrive and flourish when they have access to water. People rely on wells for water, and wells are created by human effort. There is mutual nourishment, as the well provides water to sustain people, and it is inexhaustible over time. People should learn from this virtue, diligently encouraging themselves in their endeavors.		
		
The Great Image: Water is absorbed by plants, nourishing the tree, symbolizing the act of drawing water from the well, which implies economy and repetition.		
		
Fortune: The well represents something static and immovable, so one should not be overly aggressive or enterprising in their actions and should avoid a lack of vigor. Handling matters calmly and steadily is more beneficial.		
		
Career: The situation is stable. One should neither advance rashly nor retreat, but should instead strive positively to learn and improve oneself, increasing personal strength and preparing for opportunities, which will lead to great achievements. The greatest fear is stagnation, as it may result in being deemed obsolete.		
		
Business: The market is favorable, and one can continue following the original strategy. Continue with a spirit of diligence and advancement, sincerely exploring the market. Pay special attention to cooperation with others, assisting each other, enriching and accumulating experiences in practical activities.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With proper intentions to contribute to society, one should study diligently. Special attention should be given to seeking guidance from virtuous and capable people, which could lead to recognition and recommendation.		
		
Marriage and Love: There is no need to rush; a suitable partner will appear in due course.		
		
Decision Making: Be intelligent, quick-witted, and willing to help others. There will also be opportunities to fully exhibit one's talents. By embracing the spirit of the "water well," sincerely dedicating oneself and continually enriching one's abilities, society will surely value this contribution.
- Scholar Interpretation: Still waters flow from the source, with a calm and steady movement; maintaining an unchanging position, preserving the status quo. Those who receive this hexagram should cultivate their character and nurture their nature, go with the flow, remain composed and serene; calmness brings benefit, while movement leads to misfortune.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:		
		
Fortune: Wood and water generate each other, fame and achievement are hopeful. 		
Wealth: Profit exceeds the capital, naturally pleasing. 		
Home: Repair the house and prevent water damage; yin and yang are balanced. 		
Health: The kidneys are excessively bloated, immediate treatment is necessary.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Splitting Apart

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Bo: It is unfavorable to undertake anything.		
		
The "Xiangci" (Commentary on the Image) says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The mountain rests on the earth, and wind and rain erode it; this is the image of the Bo hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, taking the warning from the falling of mountain rocks and the crumbling of cliff edges, thereby strengthening the unity and loyalty of the people, enabling them to live and work in peace and contentment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of dissimilar trigrams (with Earth below and Mountain above). Five yin lines are below, with one yang line above, representing an abundance of yin and a solitary yang; a high mountain rests on the earth. Both signify the concept of peeling away, hence it is known as the "Hexagram of Splitting Apart." In this hexagram, yin flourishes while yang declines, metaphorically indicating a time when petty people gain influence and virtuous people are in distress, leading to the ruin of enterprises.		
		
Great Image: The mountain resting upon the earth symbolizes mountains and stones collapsing to the ground, with five yin lines pressuring one yang, causing justice to be damaged.		
		
Fortunes: Misfortune surrounds you, suggesting the need to reorganize. Avoid being overconfident to prevent being implicated by women and petty individuals.		
		
Career: The times are unfavorable and driven by great trends, meaning an individual can only adapt to situations and pause actions, observing changes without taking risks. It is essential to actively create conditions, build strength, and remain cautious and patient, avoiding collaboration with petty people. The turning of fortunes will inevitably lead to accomplishing goals in the near future.		
		
Business: Having transitioned from a peak to a downturn entering a period of recession, it is essential to earnestly summarize experiences and lessons, implementing reorganizations, especially avoiding rash decisions. When favorable conditions arise, exploit them to smoothly and confidently reemerge.		
		
Seeking Recognition: The likelihood of success is low, so persistent pursuit is inadvisable. Instead, continue to create opportunities, strive to improve oneself, and enhance social skills, strengthening capabilities to seize the chance for a comeback.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Considerations must be thorough; unless a match is exceedingly suitable, do not proceed carelessly. Both parties should maintain family harmony.		
		
Decision-Making: Life is fraught with twists, often leading to unfavorable or even dire circumstances. Yet, there is a chance for revival from dire situations. By calmly analyzing situations and struggling tenaciously, one will certainly transform their fate, achieving admirable outcomes that evoke envy in others. The key is to avoid hastily seeking success, and particularly avoiding taking risks. Adapt to the trends and guard against sabotage by petty individuals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Exploitation and decay, the worry of disaster; advancement is difficult to achieve, stop in accordance with the times. For those who receive this hexagram, the time and fortune are not favorable, leading to many losses and obstacles to progress. It is advisable to stop in accordance with the times and maintain one’s duty. Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan: Fortune: The time and fortune are not favorable; maintain peace of mind and your place. Wealth: Profit from exports, exploiting others' wealth. Home: Do not leave your own home; buying a temporary residence is possible. Health: The soul is not attached, be extremely careful.

    - Description: Top Nine: Those who work hard do not get food, while those who do not work get food; the nobleman rides in a splendid carriage, while the petty person’s thatched hut does not shield against wind and rain.

The broken hut of the petty person that fails to shield against wind and rain signifies ultimately being unable to maintain peace and safety.
    - Element: bing yin wood, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise

## Hexagram Interpretation

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: After Completion

### General Information

- Description: Ji Ji Hexagram: Success. This is a divination that shows slight initial prosperity. Initially favorable, but eventually changes will occur. 		
		
The Xiangci (Commentary on the Symbolism) states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Kan, representing water; the lower trigram is Xun, representing fire. Water above, fire below, water douses fire, which is the imagery of the Ji Ji hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram and thus prepares during times without trouble, preventing calamity before it happens.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Kan above) stacked together. Kan represents water, and Li represents fire. Water and fire interact, with water above fire, overpowering the fire, successfully achieving the task of extinguishing it. "Ji" means "already"; "Ji" means "accomplished." Ji Ji signifies that things have already succeeded, but change is bound to occur eventually.		
		
The Great Image: Kan water is above Li fire. The nature of water is to move downward, while the fire tends to rise upward. When water and fire collaborate, it signifies completion.		
		
Fortune: A symbol of gaining both fame and profit, success is indicated. However, one must guard against the principle of extremes leading to reversal; initially prosperous but potentially leading to misfortune later.		
		
Career: Everything is smooth and prosperous, and even great achievements may have been accomplished. The key issue is how to maintain this momentum. It's essential to understand the truth that fortune peaks before decline, to anticipate and prevent future troubles, and to take measures before problems arise. Simultaneously, one must closely monitor the situation, seize favorable opportunities, continue to strive upward, and advance career development.		
		
Business: Benefitting from favorable market conditions, much profit has already been earned. However, this also signifies potential crises at any moment. Therefore, one must be careful and proactive, preventing issues before they arise, staying vigilant and cautious throughout the day. Additionally, actively observe market changes, adjust strategies accordingly, and explore new markets.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: The basic conditions for personal pursuit of fame and profit are already in place. It is crucial to prevent becoming rigid and conservative, which could lead to failure and abandonment halfway.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Initially smooth, but obstacles may arise midway.		
		
Decision-making: All conditions are excellent, and the environment is favorable for growth. However, this may lead to self-satisfaction, causing one to stop progressing or even become decadent and decline. One must continuously work hard, maintain humble virtues, keep a vigilant mindset, and prevent unexpected incidents.		
		
The Ji Ji hexagram is a hexagram of stacked opposites, with Li below and Kan above. Kan represents water and Li represents fire; when water and fire interact, water is above fire, overpowering the fire, completing the task of extinguishing it. "Ji" means "already"; "Ji" means "accomplished." Ji Ji signifies that things have already succeeded, but change is bound to occur eventually.		
		
The Ji Ji hexagram follows the Xiao Guo hexagram, as explained in the "Sequence of Hexagrams": "One who overcomes minor faults can achieve success, thus Ji Ji follows." Correcting minor errors leads to success, hence the discussion of the Ji Ji hexagram.		
		
In "The Image," this line explains: Water is above fire, Ji Ji; the gentleman uses foresight to prevent problems. It points out: The imagery of Ji Ji – Li (fire) below and Kan (water) above, with water over fire – symbolizes cooking food with fire, indicating that the food is cooked, representing the success of a matter; a gentleman should have a far-seeing perspective and, after success, consider potential drawbacks and prevent them before they occur by taking precautionary measures.		
		
Ji Ji symbolizes success, enlightening the truth that prosperity inevitably leads to decline. This hexagram is considered a moderately favorable one. "The Image" states: "Your name will be inscribed above the Golden List, not wasted was the effort of past hard work. For those who encounter this hexagram, fame and celebration are auspicious; everything aimed for will be successful and prosperous."
- Scholar Interpretation: Assistance and accomplishment, resolute and self-respecting; transitioning from large to small to ensure flourishing luck.		
		
For those who receive this hexagram, success in career is indicated, with a symbol of achievement. However, it is crucial to guard against decline after prosperity, and retreat is considered auspicious. Further advancement would be inauspicious.		
		
Fortune: Excessive prosperity will inevitably decline, be cautious of future troubles.		
		
Wealth: Acting promptly can yield profits.		
		
Home: A grand house can be inhabited; a harmonious hundred-year union.		
		
Health: Just recovering from a serious illness, still requires self-care.

- Line 2
    - Description: Six in the second place: A woman has lost her headscarf. There is no need to search for it; within seven days, it can be regained without seeking.

    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the second place: Shouting in fear, an enemy comes at night, but it is not enough to cause harm.

        - Element: jia yin wood, Relation: Children

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: The high ancestor waged a campaign against the Gui Fang, taking three years to defeat them.

Leading a sheep and losing it on the road leads to regret, because one did not believe in others' warnings. The Image says: The journey is difficult because the nine in the fourth position is a yang line in a yin place, resembling a person in an unfavorable situation. Not believing in others’ warnings indicates good hearing, but a lack of understanding.

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the fifth position: The Yin people make grand sacrifices to the spirits and deities with cattle, but it is not as effective as the Zhou people's modest offerings to the spirits and deities. The Zhou people, in contrast, receive the blessings of the spirits and deities.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The grand sacrifices of cattle by the Yin people to the spirits and deities are not as virtuous in intent as the Zhou people's modest offerings. The Zhou people receive the blessings of the spirits and deities, and significant good fortune will befall them.
    - Element: wu xu soil, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake

Hexagram_Interpreter: 
To analyze and interpret the hexagram you've provided, I'll follow a structured approach as outlined in your request. Let's start by examining the hexagram and its accompanying information.

## Hexagram Analysis

### Primary Hexagram: After Completion

#### General Information

- **Symbolism and Attributes**: 
  - The primary hexagram is “Ji Ji” which translates to "After Completion." The hexagram symbolizes success and accomplishment, with the image of water above fire, denoting a balance of opposites which suggests a state of achieved balance and harmony. However, this balance is delicate, and change is inevitable.
  - The hexagram suggests that while success and positive outcomes are initially favorable, one must be cautious of potential changes or reversals that could occur subsequently.

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - **Trigrams**: The upper trigram Kan (Water) and the lower trigram Li (Fire) symbolize the interaction between water and fire.
  - **Cycle Analysis**: Water overcoming Fire can be viewed as potential obstacles surfacing after initial success, necessitating vigilance.
  
- **Fortune and Career**:
  - Although favorable gains can be achieved, the key lies in maintaining gainful situations through continuous effort and foresight to mitigate potential adversities.

- **Additional Aspects**:
  - In life and decision-making, current successful conditions should be handled with care, as they have the propensity for reversal if diligence and caution are not exercised.

#### Line Information

Let's look at each line and their transformation, where applicable:

- **Line 1 (Wood, Children)**: 
  - Actions result in minor mishaps. Slight risks may not bring large adversities.
  
- **Line 2 (Soil, Demons)**: 
  - Potential loss that is temporary, hinting that lost things could return in due time. The change suggests that potential harm does not escalate.
  
- **Line 3 (Water, Sibling)**: 
  - Represents prolonged conflict and effort, caution against ineffective plans.
  
- **Line 4 (Gold, Parents)**: 
  - Anxiety and doubts, changing to difficulty in receptiveness to advice.
  
- **Line 5 (Soil, Demons)**: 
  - Grand efforts that might not immediately result in expected success, redemption through modest and sincere actions.
  
- **Line 6 (Water, Sibling)**: 
  - Indicates danger when pushing limits, overshooting can lead to risky situations.

### Interaction and Reasoning

<analyze>

Let's analyze step by step how previous examples were interpreted:

#### Example 1 (The Well Hexagram)

1. **Fortune Interpretation**:
   - The primary image of a static well suggests stability and retaining something. 
   - The line identifying Parents relates to remaining within one's environment, similar to a lost item that might still be nearby, requiring patience but eventually giving fortune.
   
#### Example 2 (Splitting Apart Hexagram)

1. **Fortune Interpretation**:
   - The self line and significance refer to hidden opportunities within known environments, acknowledging patience due to the overlap of retreating elements.

From these examples, we discern that interpretations continue by analyzing specific lines, their energies, and their changes, all while framing a narrative that ties back to the question posed.

</analyze>

<reason>

Now, following the approach found in the examples:

1. **Hexagram and Lines**: 
   - The “After Completion” hexagram indicates initial success or recovery potential, but it necessitates caution as conditions are not permanent. This echoes the scenario of attempting to recover the lost phone.
   
2. **Specific Line Analysis**:
   - The line 2, with its potential for recovering lost items, suggests that the phone could be found within a known place or could return soon. Its change implies minimal harm or loss, reflecting optimism regarding retaining lost items.
   
3. **Five Elements and Six Relatives**:
   - The interplay between components, such as water and fire, hints at overcoming previous obstacles by responding promptly and strategically rather than passively accepting conditions.

4. **Six Spirits**:
   - Utilizing the White Tiger, Black Tortoise, Azure Dragon, etc., their attributes can help frame outlooks on security, vigilance, fortune, or possible adversities.
   
Ultimately, the interpretation suggests potential success in recovery is possible, bearing in mind that situations might change unexpectedly. Patience, vigilance, and a proactive stance are highlighted as particularly important.

</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram "After Completion" suggests that your friend's lost phone has a good chance of being retrieved. There is initial success indicated, meaning the phone is likely in a recoverable state, possibly left at the location from the last use. 

However, caution is advised as the situation could change, requiring swift action and attentiveness to avoid complications. Encourage your friend to retrace steps carefully and keep communication open with the person at whose house it was last used. With diligence and caution, the phone may soon be found.
