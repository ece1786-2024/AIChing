## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Possession in Great Measure

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Great Possession: Prosperous and Unimpeded.		
		
The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.		
		
Fame: Some reputation has been gained, but do not become complacent and stagnant. Avoid indulging in worldly affairs, and continue striving upward with the help of true friends to reach new heights.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: With superior conditions, many choices are available, so it is best to proceed cautiously. Efforts should be made to maintain the family for both parties.		
		
Decision-Making: With a strong personality, courageous in overcoming difficulties, striving for progress. Numerous challenges and misfortunes arise on the path forward, and only by taking them seriously can continual success be achieved. If vigilance is relaxed, arrogance and complacency will lead to disastrous failure. Many friends and extensive social interactions can greatly aid the career, though there may also be malicious individuals attempting to undermine.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun is bright in the sky, shining upon all things; it is magnificent and prosperous, maintaining abundance and stability. Those who receive this hexagram are enjoying good fortune, with everything auspicious and great harvests, but they should be wary of the principle that extremes lead to reversal, and that at the peak of prosperity, decline may follow. 		
		
Fortunes: Unparalleled smoothness and outstanding brilliance.  		
Wealth: Proceed boldly, and wealth will come naturally.  		
Family: A household that accumulates good deeds, with descendants preserving it.  		
Health: Rising false fire, be careful with treatment.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Receptive

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Kun: Great success and prosperity. Divination regarding a mare brings good fortune. A noble person sets out on a journey, initially losing their way, but later finding their master, which is auspicious. Traveling to the southwest brings gain, while traveling to the northeast results in loss. Divination regarding settlement brings good fortune. 		
		
The "Image" commentary states: The vast expanse of the earth is level and expansive, adhering to the heavenly way. The noble person observes this hexagram, taking the earth as a model, and uses profound virtue to undertake significant responsibilities.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of the same trigrams (with Kun below and Kun above), representing the feminine principle. It symbolizes the Earth (opposite of Qian), following the Heavens, bearing all things, and extending infinitely. The Kun hexagram is symbolized by a mare, indicating that the way of the Earth is to give birth to and nurture all things, while also following the timing of Heaven with a gentle disposition. It is through "first wandering and then gaining" that Kun demonstrates submission to Qian, following Qian to grasp the correct direction, adhering to the right path, and attaining fortune.		
		
The Great Image: The vast Earth bears all things, winning people over with virtue; the benevolent are invincible.		
		
Fortune: It is not advisable to rush into things; it is better to use calmness to control movement.		
		
Career: Various ventures can be successful and achieve the expected results, but initial endeavors are unfortunate, troubled by difficulties. One must not take reckless risks, and should be cautious in speech and action, especially avoiding going it alone and being autocratic. Gaining the concern and support of friends is most important, completing the business in cooperation with others. Therefore, one should focus on inner cultivation, accumulate virtue, emulate the Earth, show tolerance and patience, and be generous and magnanimous, following principles of frankness, righteousness, and restraint. One must not be greedy for success or arrogant, but persevere and strive for success in one's career.		
		
Business: Opportunities are not very good; do not take risks, it is better to be steady. When encountering setbacks, promptly summarize experience. Pay attention to storing goods, sell them when the price is right, and exercise caution in every aspect.		
		
Seeking Fame: Relatively smooth, with the basic conditions in place, being down-to-earth and working diligently without pursuing external possessions will lead to good fortune.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Yin prevails. Using softness to overcome hardness, the woman is gentle and submissive, leading to a happy marriage and growing old together.		
		
Decision Making: Be honest and gentle, sincere with others, and enthusiastic in helping people, thus also receiving help from others. However, one may be harmed by petty people due to a lack of defense, but it will not be a serious problem. With a flexible character and varied working methods, you can navigate situations adeptly and receive commendation.
- Scholar Interpretation: Gentle, compliant, and still, these are the virtues of carrying a great burden; maintaining stillness and peace, reckless actions invite harm. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram should conform to the flow of destiny, using stillness to counteract movement. It is not advisable to act independently but rather to comply with others and cooperate together to achieve great endeavors.		
		
Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a renowned scholar of Taiwanese classical studies:		
		
Fortune: Being kind-hearted and having a far-reaching reputation.		
Wealth: Returning fully laden.		
Household: Family stability; great auspiciousness in marriage.		
Health: Gentle exercise.

        - Description: Nine in the fifth place: Universal harmony. The ruler employs a method of encircling on three sides during the hunt, leaving one side open, intentionally allowing the escaping beasts to flee. The common people are not frightened by the ruler's hunt. If one encounters this line in divination, it is auspicious.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Universal harmony is auspicious because the line of nine in the fifth place is positioned in the middle of the upper trigram, symbolizing a person abiding by the path of central rectitude. Allowing those who flee forward to escape, and capturing those charging directly, is the reason for "losing the game in front." The common people are not frightened by the ruler's hunt because the ruler usually conducts himself with uprightness.
        - Element: wu xu soil, Relation: Sibling
