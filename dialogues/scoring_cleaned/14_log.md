## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Increase

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Yi: Encountering this line during divination is advantageous for going forward, beneficial for crossing rivers and wading through waters.		
		
The Explanation of the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Xun, which symbolizes wind; the lower trigram is Zhen, which symbolizes thunder. The interaction of wind and thunder creates the image of the Yi hexagram. When a noble person observes this hexagram, they are awed by the power of wind and thunder, and thus, upon seeing goodness, they follow it; upon realizing their mistakes, they amend them.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of two different trigrams (Thunder below, Wind above). Wind signifies movement; Thunder signifies intensity. The interaction between Wind and Thunder escalates its strength, making the thunder louder. Wind and Thunder assist each other and grow together, mutually benefiting one another. This hexagram is the opposite of the Decrease hexagram. It signifies decreasing above to increase below, whereas the latter signifies decreasing below to increase above. Both hexagrams explain the principles of loss and gain.		
		
The Great Image: It represents the image of strong winds accompanied by rapid thunder, indicating the growth of power and influence. The union of the eldest son and daughter symbolizes the union of husband and wife, bringing prosperity to descendants.

As long as one is kind-hearted, pure, and humble, the career will undoubtedly grow daily, with unlimited prospects. Help others promptly and be proactive in emergencies. In developing a career, internal unity, public support, perseverance, and a fearless approach to challenges are essential.		
		
Business: Avoid pursuing small gains; granting benefits to customers will result in substantial profits. Avoid insatiable greed! During risks, seek advice from others and strive for sincere assistance.		
		
Reputation: Sincerely help others, and you will certainly receive sincere reciprocation and support, leading to successful endeavors.

- Scholar Interpretation: Decrease above and increase below, strive forward vigorously; endeavor and achieve fame, merchants gain profit. Those who obtain this hexagram are in the midst of good fortune, energetically pursue progress, receive help from others, and can achieve fame and profit. Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese national studies, interprets:		
		
Fortune: A time of satisfaction, replacing the old with the new.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gu: Great fortune and prosperity. It is beneficial for crossing water or rivers, but one must begin the journey on a day of Xin three days before the day of Jia or on a day of Ding three days after the day of Jia.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing the wind. The virtuous person resides like a mountain at the top, spreading moral teachings below. This is described as the wind beneath the mountain, an image of the Xun hexagram. A noble person observing this hexagram takes inspiration from the wind that blows across all things, rescuing the populace and implementing moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: The hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Xun, above is Gen) stacked together and is mutually complementary with the Sui hexagram. The original meaning of Gu is matter, which extends to trouble and chaos. Vessels that remain unused for a long time breed worms, symbolizing a world that has been stable for too long and has grown stagnant and corrupt, necessitating innovation, creation, governance, rectification, crisis resolution, and revitalization of business.		
		
The Image: The wind enters beneath the mountain, closed without exit, leading to decay and breeding of worms. Enthusiasm is blocked, leading to ruin through stagnation.		
		
Fortune: Everything is unsatisfactory, difficult, and confusing. It is advisable to make bold innovations; otherwise, it will lead to domestic and foreign troubles.		
		
Career: Luck is in a poor state, either due to external conditions or personal factors. Only by careful analysis of the reasons and identifying the drawbacks, with decisive and bold action, even at the risk of adventure, can obstacles be overcome. At this time, one must keep a calm mind and consult with wise people to create achievements.		
		
Business: Many disadvantages are troubling you, and it is not advisable to continue on the old path. A comprehensive analysis of market trends is needed to make decisive changes and seek alternative routes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Many difficulties and disadvantages will be encountered, which should be viewed as tests of oneself. With exceptional courage, continue to strive, while also humbly searching for one’s shortcomings and remedying them.		
		
Marriage and Love: Unsuccessful. If both parties are in love, they should go all out to bring about this matter, with the couple working together to maintain the family.		
		
Decision-Making: Born out of time, the family's or career's decline is evident, and one is in a troublesome period. Only by facing reality, being diligent, persevering, and achieving something, even at the risk of adventure, can the declining situation be salvaged. It is also necessary to patiently wait for the right opportunity when required.
- Scholar Interpretation: Three vessels are in ruin; things fall apart. With diligence and care, transformation from danger to safety is possible. For those who receive this hexagram, it is a time of difficulty and confusion, where nothing goes as desired. It is advisable to be bold in innovation, strive for improvement, and work hard, for danger can be transformed into safety.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Peirong:		
		
Timely fortune: Strive to make progress; old perspectives can change.		
		
Wealth: Accumulation is not advisable; sell promptly.		
		
Home: Rectify family conduct; be wary of personal affairs; childbirth may be problematic.

- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below Tui, above Xun) stacked together. The original meaning of "fu" is incubation, referring to the precise timing of a chick hatching from an egg, signifying trustworthiness.
