## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Power of the Great

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Da Zhuang: A favorable divination.  		
The Xiang commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Zhen, which represents thunder, and the lower trigram is Qian, which represents heaven. Thunder resounding in the sky is the image of Da Zhuang. A noble person observes this image, recognizing the formidable speed of thunder and the strictness of propriety. Consequently, they have awe and respect, adhering solely to propriety.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (Qian below and Zhen above). Zhen signifies thunder; Qian signifies heaven. Qian is strong and Zhen moves. The sky roars with thunder, clouds roll, and the momentum is grand. Yang energy is abundant, and all things grow. The strength is robust, hence it is called powerful. Large and powerful, thus it is named Great Power. The four yang lines are vigorous, proactive, and effective. Both the upper and lower are just, with correct standards and upright shadows.		
		
Image: The sound of thunder is loud, echoing through the sky, representing an image of utmost integrity and brightness, and also a strong seismic image, being one of the six conflict hexagrams.		
		
Fortune: Although fortune is strong, it has reached its peak. It is advisable to maintain peace of mind; otherwise, it will lead to failure. One must remember that things reverse when they reach the extreme.		
		
Career: In dealing with the world, rely on wisdom, not strength. Have courage and also strategy, and avoid reckless actions. If you should keep yourself in place, do not move recklessly to avoid disaster. Do not overreach, or you will encounter danger. Be cautious of vile people and never underestimate their treachery. Courageously advance in your career, but avoid impulsiveness.		
		
Business: In a period of boom, the situation is favorable. However, do not overreach, nor act rashly. Actively enhance cooperation with others. Stay alert and understand the principle that things reverse when they reach the extreme. Prepare for a downturn in business.		
		
Fame: Be sure to wisely harness your power and do not rely on your strength to advance rashly, especially not with arrogance. Properly utilize your talents, along with external assistance, to surely achieve something.		
		
Marriage: Never be arrogant due to your own favorable conditions. Do not miss a good marriage opportunity.		
		
Decision-making: Maintain appropriate strength and do not overly exhaust yourself. When things go smoothly in your career, particularly avoid acting rashly. Pay special attention, as you may already be in a dilemma, and must preserve yourself while waiting for an opportunity, preparing for an early move.
- Scholar Interpretation: Be upright and magnanimous, strong and robust; be tolerant and amiable, and avoid impulsiveness at all costs. For those who receive this hexagram, the fortune is excessively strong. It is advisable to remain calm and act cautiously; otherwise, mistakes are inevitable. Explanation by the eminent Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong: 		
		
Timing: Achieving fame is not difficult, but do not be arrogant. 		
Wealth: Sell at a fair price, do not be overly greedy. 		
Home: Take care to prevent fires; treat each other with respect as guests. 		
Health: Take care of your feet.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: At the beginning of nine: Injured at the toes. If you encounter this line during divination, setting out on an expedition will bring misfortune, but there is still some gain to be had.  		
The "Image Commentary" states: Relying on strong military forces to invade another nation, although there are gains, credibility is completely lost.
    - Element: jia zi water, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Continuous digging, without ceasing, leads to divination of peril, offering no benefit. The peril of continuous digging arises because seeking depth recklessly inevitably leads to the disaster of collapse.
        - Element: xin chou soil, Relation: Sibling

- Line 2
    - Description: Nine in the second place: The oracle brings auspicious signs.  		
The "Image" says:
    - Element: jia yin wood, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: The inferior man captures animals relying on his physical strength, while the superior man captures animals by depending on nets and enclosures. Divination received a portent of danger. The public ram charges the fence with its horns, ending up caught by the bars.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The inferior man captures animals relying on his physical strength, while the superior man captures animals by depending on nets and enclosures.
    - Element: jia chen soil, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Inquiring brings a fortunate omen, with no regrets. This is because the ram breaks through the hedge, escaping its confinement, but then gets injured by the wheels and can no longer rush recklessly.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Breaking through the hedge, freeing from confinement, fearing it may collide elsewhere.
    - Element: geng wu fire, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird

- Line 5
    - Description: Six Five: Losing sheep in the land of Di. When this line is encountered during divination, there are no major disasters.		
		
The commentary on the image says: Losing sheep in the land of Di, because the yin line of Six Five occupies a yang position, indicates an inappropriate position, similar to a person being in an unsuitable environment, and thus they will suffer a loss.
    - Element: geng shen gold, Relation: Children, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Six: The ram's horns are caught in the fence, unable to retreat or advance, creating an unfavorable situation. However, although currently in a difficult position, ultimately the situation can be resolved favorably.		
		
The Xiangci states: Being unable to retreat or advance and being trapped between advancing and retreating is to encounter misfortune. Although one is in difficulty, the situation can ultimately be resolved favorably, suggesting that the disaster will not last long.
    - Element: geng xu soil, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
From the hexagram image, Demons occupy gold and take the position of the principal line, with the line at Xū soil overlain by western gold, showing strength, while the principal line's fire is weak. Inquiring about the son's illness, the Shēn Children line is used as the significant line. Within the hexagram, Wù Xū fire stands as the Children line, with the response line Xū soil interacting with western gold, which is auspicious. However, it is unfavorable that the Children line's fire is being subdued, indicating the son's illness is rather severe.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Joyous, Lake

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Dui: Prosperity. Auspicious in divination.  		
		
The "Image" says: This hexagram consists of two Dui trigrams, which represent marsh. The image of Dui is two marshes connected, symbolizing the exchange of waters. A noble person observing this hexagram thereby broadens friendships, studies and explores, and expands their knowledge and experiences.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of two identical trigrams (water below, water above) overlapping. Marsh or lake signifies water. When two bodies of water connect, their flows intermingle harmoniously, fostering unity, mutual assistance among friends, and joyous happiness. The trigram Dui represents joy. It embodies the virtue of firm strength within, expressed in an outward appearance of gentleness and harmony. Steadfastly adhering to the path of righteousness, it guides the people towards elevation.		
		
Great Image: Two lakes rely on each other, further complemented by the reflection of the moon in their waters. These beautiful scenes and ideal times evoke delight and pleasure.		
		
Fortune: A mix of sadness and joy, accompanied by praise and criticism. By holding to the righteous path, things are generally satisfactory.		
		
Career: Due to strong interpersonal skills, you can unite others and receive assistance; thus, all endeavors progress smoothly. As long as one adheres to the path of integrity, with pure intentions, clarity of right and wrong, and treats others sincerely and amiably, the future will be bright.		
		
Business: Very favorable, allowing for support from multiple channels. However, during prosperous times, do not forget the principles of caution and vigilance, especially against being misled by deceitful individuals.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: As long as one's aims are pure and there is genuine talent and knowledge, one can certainly receive enthusiastic help and support from multiple sources, thus achieving the goal.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Both parties are satisfied, with a high likelihood of success. However, excessive insistence on personal opinions should be avoided.		
		
Decision-making: Intelligent, cheerful, flexible, kind-hearted, and enthusiastic about public service, possessing organizational talent. Hence, one may smoothly ascend to leadership positions. Yet, it is crucial to uphold the principles of integrity, conduct affairs impartially, avoid flattering superiors, and never oppress the people. Always maintain a humble demeanor and avoid overconfidence, or one may easily become surrounded by malevolent individuals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Lakes nourish all things, bringing double joy; harmony among groups, steadfastly adhering to the righteous path. Those who receive this hexagram will encounter many celebrations and harmonious human relations, yet they must firmly uphold the righteous path, or else risk misfortune.		
		
Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great scholar in Taiwan.		
		
Fortune: Supported by friends, cherish it well.  		
Wealth: Assistance from others, earning profits is not difficult.  		
Home: Live with friends; marriage through friendship.  		
Health: Can be treated by an experienced doctor.

    - Description: Nine in the fifth place: The state is stripped and captured. The act of unjust provocation by the stripped state will certainly lead to punishment (for us, misfortune will turn into fortune).

        Here's the information about the hexagram(s) I got:

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Preponderance of the Great

### General Information

- Description: The Da Guo hexagram: The roof beam is bent under pressure. There is advantage in going forward, and it is smooth and favorable. 		
		
The Xiangci (Commentary on the Image) says: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Dui, representing a lake, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing wood. With upper Dui and lower Xun, the lake water submerges the wooden boat, which forms the image of Da Guo. The gentleman observes this hexagram image and takes the lesson of a capsized boat due to its weight as a warning, realizing that in times of crisis, one should remain steadfast and unyielding, stay firm without seeking office, and maintain a tranquil and simple life.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram features a juxtaposition of dissimilar trigrams (Xun below and Dui above). Dui symbolizes a marsh or joy, while Xun represents wood or compliance, akin to a marsh's waters flooding a boat, resulting in a significant error. The yin and yang lines are reversed, yang is large, and yin is small, indicating extreme activity and an image of excess; there is inner firmness yet outer softness.		
		
Main Image: The middle four yang lines resemble solid beams, but with yin lines at the beginning and end, the strength is insufficient to support them, suggesting a tendency towards collapse.		
		
Fortunes: There is an image of strength not being sufficient to meet one's desires, leading to an overwhelming burden, multiple worries, with a need to guard against legal entanglements and water hazards.		
		
Career: There are hidden dangers and even crises in business, necessitating utmost caution and prudence. Adhering to the middle path is crucial, using humility and kindness, with boldness and meticulousness, seeking assistance from others. Resorting to unconventional methods and taking risks may be necessary under specific circumstances.		
		
Commerce: Impatience and overly rapid development prompt the need for contraction and adjustment. Competition is at a disadvantageous stage, so avoid overconfidence and obstinacy. Constantly evaluate the situation and act when opportunities arise. When there is assured confidence, one should not shy away from taking risks to achieve improvements in conditions.		
		
Reputation: It is most undesirable to seek impractical accolades, leading to great fame not matching reality. Only through humility, cautious actions, devoted effort, and disregard for public gossip, while steadfastly pursuing initial goals, can success be achieved.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Self-awareness is of utmost importance; do not rush for success. Careful consideration and proper means are vital for achieving success. However, using necessary shrewd strategies is not out of the question.		
		
Decision-Making: In critical times, improper handling can be extremely disadvantageous. Addressing the actual situation requires neither rash actions nor indecision, but rather a blend of firmness and softness. Seek others' opinions with humility, act cautiously, pursue boldly, unafraid of rumors, to strive for an improved situation.
- Scholar Interpretation: Yang is abundant, yin is scarce; the situation is about to overturn. Both the foundation and the end are weak, act according to your capacity. Those who receive this hexagram experience unrest in body and mind, things do not go as intended, yet they persist stubbornly, leading to great regret later. Beware of legal disputes and water hazards.		
		
By Fu Peirong, a renowned scholar of Taiwanese Confucianism:		
		
Fortune: Reflect and restrain yourself, it is not the time to seek fame.		
Wealth: Prices rise from low to high, difficult to grasp.		
Home: Prevent imbalance; marriage between young and old.		
Health: Both liver and kidneys are exhausted, not easy to heal.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: First Line: Reverently placing offerings on a mat of white straw allows one to avoid calamity.  		
The Commentary on the Image says: “Reverently placing offerings on a mat of white straw”—a soft thing is laid underneath, just like the Yin line at the bottom position of the hexagram.
    - Element: xin chou soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying

- Line 2
    - Description: Nine in the second place: A withered willow puts forth sprouts. An old man marries a young woman, which is not inauspicious.		
		
The commentary says: An elder husband and a young wife, the disparity in age is improper, and this is a mistaken union.
    - Element: xin xuan water, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: The curved beam of the roof is an omen of misfortune.  		
The Commentary on the Image says: The curved beam of the roof is dangerous because when the ridgepole bends, the house cannot be supported and will collapse.
    - Element: xin you gold, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth position: The roof beam is upright, which is auspicious. However, unforeseen troubles are not easy to handle.  		
The Commentary on the Image says: The reason the upright roof beam is auspicious is that when the beam is not bent, the house does not collapse.
    - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the fifth place: The withered poplar blossoms. An old woman marries a young man. This matter is neither good nor bad.  		
The Commentary on the Image says: The withered poplar blossoms, how can its flowers bloom long without fading? An old woman marrying a young man is not a particularly honorable thing.
    - Element: ding you gold, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

- Line 6
    - Description: Top six: Blindly wading through water, the water is deep above the head. Although encountering danger, ultimately there is no disaster.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Blindly wading through water invites danger. At this point, blame is of no benefit.
    - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger


        
**Here's my question: When will my wife recover from fever?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step how the interpretations in Examples 1 and 2 are derived:

<analyze>

**Example 1:**

1. **Identify the hexagram and overall theme**:
   - The main hexagram here is "The Power of the Great." It's associated with vigorous energy and potential overreaching.
   
2. **Line Analysis**:
   - *Line 1 (Water, Wife and Wealth, White Tiger)*: The change here suggests injury or peril due to its aggressive nature; related to the manifestation of illness.
   - The "spirit" associated with each line also gives context: the White Tiger is often seen as indicating challenges or difficulties.
   
3. **Interaction and Relation**:
   - Here, the elements (fire of the children line and soil of the response line) relate with each other and indicate underlying concerns (fire subdued by soil) as the illness.

4. **Scholars' Guidance**:
   - Scholar interpretations emphasize harmony between strong potential and innate danger, typifying challenges when too extreme. Advice around caution is recurrent, stressing appropriate action without excessiveness.
   
5. **Conclusion from Lines and Overall Hexagram**:
   - From this, the example suggests a severe illness, and attention to the "Children line" becomes crucial in assessing recovery.

**Example 2:**

1. **Hexagram Overview**:
   - The primary hexagram is "The Joyous, Lake," signifying prosperity but also a harmonious balance that can include fluctuations.

2. **Line Changes and Interaction**:
   - *Initial Nine*: Good fortune through harmony. But changes indicate discomfort, hinting at a perspective shift required during medical treatment (possibly related to recognizing root issues).

3. **Understanding Body and Timing**:
   - Each line involves six spirits and elements that, when combined with timing, offer foresight into health interventions and outlooks (e.g., Parents line in prosperity, acknowledging a doctor could lead to an improvement).

4. **Reading Elements Together**:
   - When water elements mix with other elements like fire, potential concerns are revealed, or advice on managing issues appears.

5. **Application of Lines to Health**:
   - The changes reflect the balancing act between external influences and internal state, suggesting improvement under qualified care.

In both interpretations, the interaction between lines, elements, and hexagrams informs judgments on health outcomes and strategies.

</analyze>

<reason>

For your question regarding when your wife will recover from fever, let's examine the given hexagram: "Preponderance of the Great."

The **Traditional Interpretation** signals the need to handle situations with care to avoid being overwhelmed by pressure — mirroring your wife's current health challenge.

**Line Analysis**:

- *Line 2 (Water, Parents, Azure Dragon)*: The image of a mature union that isn't conventional warns of caution. Water suggests nourishing and fluid dynamics in health, while Azure Dragon brings hope and potential renewal.
  
- *Line 6 (Soil, Wife and Wealth, White Tiger)*: It shows danger by blindly wading into deep waters, but ultimately there's resolution without disaster.

The current situation signifies a challenge, but her recovery appears possible. The reading describes the necessity for careful navigation with expert help (symbolic of the old and young union).

**Interactions in Relations and Elements**:
- Water (the Parents line) is nourishing wood but clashes with soil, reflecting how careful adjustments (perhaps medical) are underway but face obstacles. This is akin to how fever can wane if properly treated.
  
- Each hexagram level tells us about strength and the lesson of 'Da Guo', ensuring the fever peaks but is unlikely to persist long-term with correct measures.

Given the whole hexagram, it suggests a pivotal phase but points toward gradual improvement as equilibrium and softer methods counteract harsh pressures.

By understanding this balance, you must manage expectations and continue to support healing practices, with careful optimism for her eventual recovery.

</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Based on the hexagram "Preponderance of the Great," your wife's fever will peak before it starts to diminish. The interpretation suggests that with careful attention and appropriate medical guidance, she should recover in due course. It's important to proceed cautiously and ensure she receives proper care to navigate through this period effectively. Be patient, as the outlook is positive for improvement with time.
