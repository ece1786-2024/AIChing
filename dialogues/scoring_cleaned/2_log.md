## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (P«ê) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.		
		
Career: The situation is adverse, the career is in a declining phase, with many difficulties. There is interference from antagonistic people leading to frustration and many setbacks. One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.

When the time is right, things will surely proceed smoothly.

Your financial fortune in the coming year requires patience and strategic caution. The hexagram 'Waiting (Nourishment)' advises that the timing is not yet ripe for substantial progress. There are indications of financial constraints and challenges, particularly around immediate wealth accumulation, heightened by the influence of key lines.
