      "\n",
      "1. **Hexagram Information:**\n",
      "   - **Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation):** Represents obstruction and lack of progress, warning against conflicts and advising patience. It suggests a tough period with possible endings and requires caution and wait for a better moment to act.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Line Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Line 1:** Starting position depicting early corrective actions and symbolizes auspiciousness. It changes to a more disciplined approach by avoiding reckless actions.\n",
      "   - **Line 3 (Shi Line):** Illustrates a wealth line in a state of concealment, indicating dormant potential or unutilized opportunities in wealth and positions.\n",
      "   - **Line 2 (Demons Line):** Although marked with a prosperous state, the clash indicates challenges, possibly owing to unfavorable daily influences.\n",
      "   - **Line 4 and 5:** Related to rewards and dangers, which suggest that without proper positioning, achieving recognition (and thus a raise) may be difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hexagram Image and Relations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Current obstacles are clearly depicted by the hexagram of Stagnation, needing careful navigation through obstacles.\n",
      "   - Relationships: The Ki energy shows internal competence and potential, yet external hindrances suggest awaiting prudent actions.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Transformation and Movement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Changed Lines indicate small eventual advancements can happen, but these do not immediately relate to the salary; rather, they focus on necessary adjustments and readiness for opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Accumulating favorable conditions requires patience, avoiding impulsive efforts, and possibly resigning to current positions until obstructions pass so that it's appropriate for higher rewards. There's a potential for termination of adverse conditions, hinting at the eventual but delayed arrival of positive changes. Therefore, patience and strategic alignment are advised for eventual success.\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      "The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the lower trigram is Gen, which represents a mountain, and the upper trigram is Dui, which represents a marsh. When there is a marsh within a mountain, the air of the mountain and the water cease, mutually responding to each other; this forms the image of the hexagram Xian. A noble person observes this image and follows the example of the deep and profound valleys, and vast and expansive marshes, thereby becoming open-minded, and with an attitude of humility, accepts others' teachings and guidance.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams stacked (below is Gen, above is Dui). Gen is the mountain; Dui is the lake. Dui is flexible on top, Gen is firm below, the water seeps downward, the flexible rises above and the firm is below, responding to each other. Response leads to achievement.\t\t\n",

      "Fortune: Auspicious and agreeable, but do not let improper affections disturb your mind.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Career: Harmony is valuable, and everything flourishes with harmony. Work to move others sincerely and treat people with honesty. Broadly interact with friends, with humility and courtesy. Set lofty ambitions, adhere to your own views, but do not blindly follow the crowd. When unfavorable, stay put and wait for the right opportunity; do not rashly force it.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Business: There are profits to be gained. However, maintain sincere intentions, treat others honestly, and enhance cooperation. If the market is sluggish, do not act rashly or forcefully. Instead, wait calmly for developments and humbly listen to different opinions.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Reputation: Your aspirations should be grand, proceed with solid steps, and humbly seek advice from others to gain favor and support. Do not isolate yourself, nor be cold and solitary. Develop yourself with a broad mind.\t\t\n",

      "Marriage and love: The possibility of success is great. Both parties have strong feelings, but motives must be pure; only then can the marriage be happy and lasting.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Decision-making: Auspicious and favorable. Good interpersonal relations and adept at socializing. With a sincere attitude and a selfless heart, there will be no disadvantageous situations. In cooperation with others, adhere to principles. Do not be indecisive in handling matters. In adverse conditions, cease action, summarize experiences, and seek development. Treat others sincerely, but avoid associating with crafty individuals who wield words deceitfully, to prevent being deceived.\n",

The ancient kings observed this hexagram, thereby inspiring themselves to strive with diligence, comply with the seasons, and nurture all things.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram involves the overlay of different trigrams: Zhen below and Qian above. Qian represents the heavens, firmness, and vigor; Zhen stands for thunder, firmness, and movement.

Focus on the process rather than the outcome, pursue sincerely, act when the timing is right, and success in one's career will follow.\t\t\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      "Decision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.\n",

Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable.
