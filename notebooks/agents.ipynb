Wind moves swiftly over water, assisting its force and spreading in all directions. This hexagram, called Disperse, signifies the scattering of water, symbolizing the dispersion of organizations and human hearts. It must be overcome with active means and methods to defeat drawbacks, rescue dispersal, and turn danger into safety. \\n\\nThe Great Image: Wind blows over the water, spreading and dispersing. It is also like the spring breeze that dissipates the severe cold, causing ice and snow to melt.\\n\\nFortunes: Although there are worries, difficulties can ultimately be resolved, and all endeavors will prosper. Avoid capriciousness and sluggishness.\\n\\nCareer: You are in a relatively difficult position, primarily due to a lack of unity. Strong measures must be taken to seek stability and unity. Most importantly, adhere to the righteous path, maintain an impartial and selfless spirit, and earn people’s hearts to gather the dispersed.\\n\\nBusiness: Market conditions are chaotic and directionless. Taking appropriate risks is absolutely necessary. One must be fair and selfless, restrain personal desires, and it is equally necessary to strive for powerful partners and support.\\n\\nPursuit of Fame: One must calm down, work hard to learn, and improve knowledge and skills. The situation of dispersal must be managed, requiring talent from various fields. The future is bright, with success depending crucially on individual effort.\\n\\nMarriage and Relationships: As long as both parties hold pure intentions, success and happiness are inevitable.\\n\\nDecision Making: To advance one's career, positive means must be employed to overcome and conquer the maladies of internal discord. One must first eliminate selfishness, sacrifice the lesser self for the greater self, and avoid getting involved in disputes. By doing so, a stable situation can be regained, and in a favorable environment, the prospect of every undertaking is bright.\", 'philosophy': 'The Huan hexagram is a hexagram formed by stacking different trigrams, with the lower trigram being Kan and the upper trigram being Xun. This represents wind moving over water, a force that pushes waves and causes them to overflow on all sides. Ancient observers noted that if there was a pool of water on the ground, it would dry up faster in windy weather than when there was no wind, leading them to realize that the wind disperses the water. When encountering a hexagram with Kan water below and Xun wind above, it naturally brings to mind that the wind above can disperse the water, and so this Kan below, Xun above hexagram is called Huan. However, the wind dispersing the water also turns it into clouds, bringing rain to people. Thus, even though Huan implies the dispersal of water, symbolizing disorganization and disunity, with proactive measures and methods to overcome challenges, one can rectify the disunity and turn danger into safety.\\n\\nThe Huan hexagram follows the Dui hexagram, and the \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" explains it as: \"After joy, people\\'s hearts may become dispersed, and so it follows with Huan.\" The \"Image\" explains it as: \"Wind moves over the water, Huan; the former kings offered sacrifices to the emperor and built temples.\" This indicates that the image of Huan is Kan (water) below and Xun (wind) above, representing the phenomenon of wind moving over the water, symbolizing dispersion and separation. Former kings organized sacrifices to the heavenly emperor and constructed temples to gather and unify people\\'s hearts. The Huan hexagram symbolizes dispersion and provides insights into how to salvage disunity, belonging to the lower trigram. The \"Image\" analysis concludes this hexagram with: \"Across the river, one sees a lump of gold, desiring to take it, but the banks are broad and the water is deep. Hoping for wealth proves difficult to obtain, and through the night, wealth and effort are wasted without gain.\"'}, 'line_1': {'description': \"First Six: Use a strong rescue horse, auspicious.\\n\\nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the First Six is due to its compliance.\\n\\nThis refers to auspiciousness because the First Six, a yin line, is positioned below the Nine Two, a yang line, suggesting an intention of yin being gentle and compliant to yang's firmness.

In this situation, the first six is inherently gentle and weak, in a low position, quite dangerous. However, it correlates closely with the Nine in the second position, allowing it to rely on the strength of the Nine in the second to rescue itself.\\n\\nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the initial six lies in compliance. It points out that the initial six is auspicious because it can follow and align with yang\\'s firmness, enabling it to closely connect with the Nine in the second position.\\n\\nThose who receive this line in a divination are in a dangerous situation that is difficult to resolve depending on their ability. At this time, you need to find someone with ability to rely on and submit to them, leveraging their strength to get out of danger.'}, 'line_2': {'description': \"Nine in the second place: Dispersing and rushing to the machine, regret vanishes.  \\nThe Image says: Dispersing and rushing to the machine signifies the attainment of one's wishes.\", 'interpretation': 'Nine in the second place: The floodwaters surge swiftly, sweeping away the foundation of the house.

However, it is situated in the middle of the lower trigram Kan, which is a position of danger. Furthermore, its upward progression is obstructed, and it does not receive recognition or important roles from the leaders in the upper trigram. Fortunately, it gains support from the Initial Six below. Therefore, during turbulent times, even though it cannot find a strong backing, it can still find a place of safety and be sheltered by the Initial Six. This allows it to accumulate strength while awaiting new opportunities.\\n\\nIn the \"Xiangs,\" the analysis of this line is as follows: \"Dispersion flees to its resting place,\" achieving one\\'s wish. Here, it points out: \"In times of dispersion, one should swiftly leave a dangerous situation and move to a safe place.\" By escaping danger, regret vanishes and one\\'s wish is fulfilled.\\n\\nFor those who draw this line, they are in the midst of a chaotic and dangerous situation. Do not rely on leaders to protect you; you should quickly leave this situation and temporarily avoid the limelight.

It is gentle in nature yet discontent with the current situation. It does not interact with the six in the fifth, but it corresponds directly with the nine in the uppermost position.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image explains it this way: \"Dispersion affects one\\'s self,\" indicating that the ambition lies outside. Here it points out: \"Dispersion occurs within oneself,\" showing that the ambition is directed outward. Although six in the third line lacks the strength to resolve its difficulty of dispersion, it has help from the upper six, so it will not face distress.\\n\\nFor those who draw this line, if they encounter trouble in work or life, seeking help from a superior may not be effective.

As a minister close to the ruler, these qualities are very important, demonstrating that one can have harmonious relations with the nine in the fifth place ruler and gain his trust and appreciation.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the Huan Hexagram, dispersion has occurred because the first six has formed a faction with the nine in the second place, and the six in the third place is closely linked with the nine at the top. The nine in the fourth place, as a minister close to the ruler, aids in governing and mitigating dispersion, combating factions, achieving great success, and gathering everyone around the monarch.\\n\\nIn the Image, it is analyzed as: “Disperse their group, great good fortune,” which means to broaden.

In the face of a scattered situation, the monarch decides to resolve the accumulated distress like curing an illness through perspiration.

It is in opposition to the Nine-Five, indicating a confrontational situation, leading to rejection and attacks by the leader. The top nine corresponds with the Six-Three of the lower trigram, meaning that by abandoning the current position and identity, moving away from the Nine-Five, and joining with the Nine-Three, there will be no disaster.\\n\\nThe \"Images\" explains this line: \"Disperse one\\'s blood,\" means staying away from harm. It points out that \"avoiding harm\" involves distancing oneself from danger.\\n\\nFor those who obtain this line, it suggests that the situation is beyond recovery. You must decisively withdraw and stay far away from the danger that threatens you. Although you have contributed greatly to your current unit, acted as a major contributor, you should not regard yourself as indispensable. The leader does not appreciate you and might suppress you due to your following within the unit.

However, the initial nine is at the beginning of the Dui hexagram, which represents a young woman. In ancient times, it was encouraged that well-bred women should \"not go past the main gate or the second gate,\" requiring restraint in their actions to display cultured behavior. If one often went out and did not understand self-restraint, their reputation would suffer. Considering the entire hexagram, the initial nine is active but is compared to the reverse compared nine-two, which blocks it, so the upward movement is obstructed, and it is best to stay at home.\\n\\nIn the Image, this yao is analyzed as: \"Not going beyond the courtyard\" indicates an understanding of when to advance or retreat. This suggests that \"not stepping outside\" implies knowing when to move forward when the way is open and to stop when it is blocked.\\n\\nFor those who draw this Yao, it is advised not to go out recently and best to stay at home. Although this might conflict with your active nature, you need to restrain yourself. Live a reclusive life willingly, embrace solitude, and as long as you do not go out, there will be no misfortune.\\n\\nInitial Nine: Do not go beyond the courtyard, no blame.\\n\\nThe Image says: Not going beyond the courtyard means understanding the circumstances of blockage and openness.\\n\\nThe textual meaning is: Not leaving the house results in no disaster.\\n\\nThe Image text means: Not leaving the house is because of understanding the timing of blockage and openness.'}, {'description': 'Top six: Bitter constraint.

However, if one regrets the excessive constraint, the danger may disappear.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram\\'s image, the Upper Six is a yin line located in a yielding position, appropriately positioned, but it resides at the highest position of the hexagram and is not central.

For instance, while frugality is a virtue, if you\\'re saving money to the extent that you don\\'t eat or dress well, this is overconstraint. Do not over-constrain yourself, as living like an ascetic or restricting your talents at work will be detrimental. The urgent task is to find a middle ground between self-indulgence and self-constraint, because excessive constraint is impractical for both oneself and others.\\n\\nUpper Six: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, but remorse vanishes.\\n\\nThe Image says: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, because the path has ended.\\n\\nThe text means that excessive bitter constraint leads to maintaining the right path brings danger, but there is no regret.\\n\\nThe Image of the text signifies that the danger of excessive constraint is due to reaching a dead end.'}]\n",

Mountain Fire Bei consists of stacked dissimilar trigrams: the lower trigram is Li, and the upper trigram is Gen. Li represents fire and brightness; Gen represents mountain and stillness. Bei refers to the luster of shells. The luster and the shells mutually reflect each other, decorating each other with interwoven colors that form a harmonious whole, appearing both elegant and bright. Therefore, Bei embodies the meaning of decoration and civilization. The Bei hexagram discusses the relationship between substance and culture, prioritizing substance while using culture to moderate, achieving civilization with restraint. \\n\\nThe Image says: \"There is fire beneath the mountain, which is Bei. The noble person uses this to illuminate all governmental affairs and dare not rashly judge cases.\" The Image points out: Li, representing fire, is below, and Gen, representing a mountain, is above. Thus, the hexagram with Li below Gen is like having fire beneath a mountain, creating a scenario where mountain and fire illuminate each other and decorate each other, which is why this hexagram is named Bei. A noble person should learn this spirit, handling all affairs of state with clear and upright behavior, and regarding judicial matters, should not make hasty judgments.\\n\\nThe Bei hexagram is among the upper-middle hexagrams, symbolizing decoration, guiding people to manifest substance through outward decoration and return to simplicity and authenticity. It advises people to be sincere and plain, not to crave empty fame. The Bei hexagram reveals the principle of highlighting substance through decoration, belonging to the upper-middle hexagrams.

The First Nine represents the lower layers of society, who typically do not travel by carriage. As life becomes more affluent, in order to facilitate walking, people begin to adorn their feet. How is it adorned?

Explanation of the Yao Text\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: decorate the elder\\'s beard. Grooming beards, today, is something men often do. Therefore, this idea may not hold much significance for modern people, but it was very useful for the ancients. The ancients believed that \"the skin and hair of the body are received from the parents,\" and thus they shouldn\\'t easily cut their hair or shave their beards. Consequently, beards would grow longer and longer. If not properly groomed, it would indeed affect one\\'s appearance. However, if groomed appropriately, it could also show a manly charm. The ancients had different terms for beards depending on their parts. The hairs above the mouth are called \"zi,\" those below the lower lip are called \"xu,\" those near the chin are called \"hu,\" and those on the cheeks are called \"ran.\" For some ancient men whose beards were too long, they had to make a silk pouch to wrap their beards.\\n\\nSix Two: Adorn the beard. Life Inspiration\\n\\nThe “Image” says: “Adorn the beard,” and align with those above. This phrase indicates that the Six Two yin line resides in a yin position, with a gentle disposition. \"Adorning the elder\\'s beard\" implies that the Six Two line is in harmony with the Nine Three line above, mutually embellishing each other. For one who obtains this line in divination, it suggests that at work, they should support their superior leaders and try to speak positively about them. This approach can earn them recognition from their leaders. The “Six Two” is upright and central, having no interaction with the Five, it solely interacts with the Three. The attraction between opposites is like the beard adorning the chin; they act together and complement each other beautifully.'}, 'line_3': {'description': 'Nine in the third position: Decorated as if dampened, enduring firmness brings good fortune.  \\nThe Image says: The enduring firmness and its good fortune mean eventually nothing can overcome it.', 'interpretation': 'Nine in the third place: Running forward, dripping with sweat.

It describes the adornment of the whole body, using oil to make the skin moist and glossy, and wearing brand-new clothes. Maintaining integrity within leads to good fortune. It suggests that one should not only focus on outward appearance but also on inner beauty. With virtue at heart and the ability to persist in this virtue, good fortune will ensue. In times of peace, a well-dressed, dignified, and charismatic person, who is also kind and pure of heart—whose external beauty is united with inner beauty, truly aligning inside and out—how can such a person not be fortunate? Such individuals are often favored by leaders for appointment and promotion; neighbors and colleagues also seek their company.\\n\\nWe often witness this scene: on joyous occasions, many households begin to paint doors or buildings anew, adorning them afresh.

The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner one seeks to marry. Wearing clean, beautiful new clothes, riding a white horse, what is the purpose? It is not to rob but to propose. In these prosperous times, there is more emphasis on personal appearance when proposing. Generally, each era develops new customs, with such changes reflecting the progress of the times. In ancient times, proposals involved bloody kidnappings, followed by ghostly appearances at weddings. Now, as people have become more affluent, a healthier way of proposing has begun. Wearing clean and beautiful clothes and riding a clean and beautiful white horse, this method of proposing reflects the pursuit of cleanliness and health.\\n\\nThe fourth line is a yin line in a soft position, gaining influence. However, line four naturally possesses characteristics of fear and suspicion, causing hesitation in actions.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"The fourth line is in place, indicating doubt; \\'not a robber, but a marriage alliance\\', there will be no blame in the end.\"\\n\\nThis advises those who draw this line: Although the fourth line is rightly positioned, the heart is full of doubts. \"The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner.\" It suggests proceeding confidently, and eventually, there will be no regrets. Those who draw this line may pursue speed, appearing impatient, which requires attention. If you are a gentleman, you might be quick-tempered. However, when interacting with women, it is important to be gentle and strive to maintain a long-term relationship with her.'}, 'line_5': {'description': 'The line six in the fifth place: Adorned with hills and gardens, the bundle of silk is small.

Explanation of the Line Statement:\\n\\nHills and gardens refer to desolate, natural places like mountain forests, metaphorically representing wise hermits choosing to reside there. Silk cloth refers to woven silk. A bundle is a unit of measurement, five bolts of silk make a bundle. The bundle of silk here refers to a gift. Meager: refers to something of little quantity or value.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line statement is: To decorate hills and gardens, using plain and simple adornments, and then presenting a thin bundle of silk to employ a wise person; although there might be some regret, ultimately it will be auspicious.\\n\\nThe Six Five is in the position of the king, and his decoration appears more grand. He adorns the royal gardens, using a large quantity of colored silk fabric. This act naturally has elements of extravagance, leading to some worry. But ultimately, it is auspicious, as a prosperous nation frequently encounters joyous events, and other feudal states often come to visit. By decorating the gardens, the king can elevate his status in the eyes of the feudal lords.\\n\\nThe meaning of the text is: Decorating hills and gardens, using a large amount of silk cloth, brings concern, yet ultimately brings good fortune. The symbolic meaning is: The good fortune of the Six Five line lies in joyous occasions.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the Six Five line is in the ruler's position, but it is a yin line at this position, indicating the trait of a yin line to adopt a conciliatory approach and possess the virtue of esteeming the worthy and respecting the capable. The topmost nine, a yang line, assists the Six Five in the hexagram, allowing the enterprise to thrive. However, in the hexagram structure, the upper hexagram is Gen, representing mountains and wilderness. The topmost nine, being a yang line, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Six Five, indicating it represents either a retired old official or a reclusive wise person. After assisting the Six Five, the Six Five rewards him. Although the reward may seem meager, this act itself surpasses material value, and since such a wise person does not value material rewards, even though the Six Five might appear somewhat frugal, the outcome is auspicious.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line in a divination, it suggests that in your work you encounter difficulties, and someone comes forward to assist you in resolving them. This person is not your subordinate or colleague, nor in charge of the matter, but rather a friend or someone capable outside your organization. After receiving assistance, you should express your gratitude. The value of the gift is not important, just the act of thanking will bring good fortune.\"}, 'line_6': {'description': 'Top nine: The plain adornment is without fault.  \\nThe Image says: The plain adornment without fault indicates that the highest is fulfilled.', 'interpretation': 'Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image states: The white silk adorned with multicolored patterns signifies no disaster, because the Top Nine occupies the premier position in the hexagram, like a person in a high position, content and satisfied.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Peaceful: Those who receive this line must guard against good fortune turning bad, and there may be elders in the family or relatives who pass away. Those in official positions may be promoted.\\n\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\\n\\nFortune: Good fortune has ended, be content with simplicity and comfort.\\n\\nWealth: Direct sale, still profitable.\\n\\nHome: Pure and noble.\\n\\nHealth: Light conversation to dispel heat, possible passing away.', 'philosophy': 'The hexagram of Bì, Line 6. Line saying: \"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\"\\n\\n\"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\" Explanation of the line saying: \\n\\nWhite signifies the color white, which extends to mean purity and the natural color, embodying the notion of returning to simplicity and truth. The meaning of this line is: using white for adornment, not favoring ostentation, there is no harm. White is a modest color, yet its decorative effect is very good. The upper nine indicates the extreme of things, and generally speaking, when things develop to an extreme, they are not good. However, for adornment, it is different, as the extreme of adornment returns to a state of simplicity, back to a simple state. Looking at the way people dressed in our country after its founding, we find that the highest realm of dress was still simplicity. For example, before the 1980s, people\\'s clothing was uniform in blue, green, and red. After the 1980s, as living standards improved, people started wearing exotic clothes, with a variety of colors and a multitude of styles, but looking at it today, the main fashion market is still dominated by simple one-color clothing. And white clothing has always been a symbol of nobility, unchanged from thousands of years ago until today. Blue clothing has consistently been the best-selling clothing, and the kind most people wear. So, the art of embellishment and decoration follows a cyclical process, returning to the beginning once it reaches the extreme.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"White adornment, no blame,\" indicating the upper achieves its purpose. \\n\\nThis advises people: to return to the original pure state, do not use external decorations to beautify. Within the simple and practical form, one can better appreciate the natural beauty of life itself. \\n\\nIf you obtain this line, should you wish to meet someone, there is no need to dress up deliberately; maintaining natural beauty will not lead to mistakes.'}}\n",

This line indicates that before the wild geese migrate and travel far, they gather at the riverbank to prepare for their journey as a group. The young geese, unaware of the journey\\'s hardships, are impatient and thus criticized by others. If one acts with gradual progress, they will not be harmed.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram, the Initial Six is a yin line residing in a gentle position, with attributes of softness and weakness, resembling the small geese with insufficient capability. Situated in the beginning position, it is not centralized, suggesting that actions lack moderation and lean towards impulsiveness, like the impatient young geese eager to migrate but lacking sufficient ability, thus drawing criticism. However, others see them as young and inexperienced and will not be harsh, instead offering help after the criticism.\\n\\nThe commentary from \"The Image\" explains this line: \"The young one\\'s danger—there is no blame.\" It indicates: \"The small geese are unaware of the journey\\'s hazards and are impatient, attracting criticism from others,\" but no real danger ensues.\\n\\nFor one drawing this line, it may indicate youth or recent graduation into the workforce or entering a new, unfamiliar industry. There might be an important task at the workplace that others are planning carefully. If you think such preparation unnecessary and choose to act directly, leaders or senior employees might reprimand you, but recognizing you are new and inexperienced, they will not overly discourage you.\\n\\nThose who receive this line must realize their youthful ignorance or lack of experience and avoid acting rashly. Progress should be gradual. Gather strength and refrain from rushing to express opinions. Observe how others act and follow suit to avoid blame.\\n\\nText of the line: \"Initial Six: The wild goose gradually approaches the shore; there is danger for the young one, there are words, but there is no blame.\"\\n\\nThe Image says: \"The young one\\'s danger—from a moral standpoint, there should be no unexpected difficulties.\"\\n\\nThe text\\'s meaning is: The large geese gradually reach the water\\'s edge; the young goose is in danger but is called back by the older ones, avoiding disaster.\\n\\nThe commentary\\'s meaning is: The danger to the young goose, morally speaking, should not come with unexpected hardship.'}, {'description': 'Nine in the fifth place: The wild geese gradually proceed to the high mound.

Ultimately, no ill prevails, leading to good fortune. Explanation of the line: The meaning of this line is that the wild geese fly up and gradually advance to the hill, similar to a husband being away, and the wife not conceiving for three years. But ultimately evil cannot triumph over virtue, and thus brings good fortune. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the ninth line sits correctly in the position of leadership and maintains integrity. Its proper correspondence with the second line symbolizes a husband and wife maintaining their positions and finally achieving good fortune.\\n\\nThe \\'Image\\' explains this line as \"Ultimately, no ill prevails, leading to good fortune; this fulfills one’s desires.\" It points out that \"evil cannot prevail over virtue in the end, thus bringing good fortune,\" fulfilling the wish for a couple\\'s reunion. \\n\\nFor someone receiving this line in a divination, it indicates that in business, one may encounter obstacles, but by adhering to the righteous path and making efforts to overcome these obstacles, they can finally achieve their goals. In marriage, due to various hindrances, the couple may find it difficult to reunite, but their mutual loyalty and unyielding faithfulness ultimately lead to reunion. \\n\\nNine in the fifth place: The wild geese gradually progress to the mound; the wife does not conceive for three years.

      "  \n",
      "To seek wealth, the Water element associated with the Wife/Fortune line should be used. This hexagram is represented by the Grandchild's Metal element signifying the Subject, while the Wife/Fortune line perfectly aligns with the Correspondent line. The positions of the Subject and Correspondent are found in the hexagram's Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird, located at the upper and lower positions of the six lines, respectively, and form a partial union of Shen and Zi. They occupy all the critical positions in the hexagram. The Brother line is an unfavorable element; although it is active, it transforms into retreat, and its residual energy forms a triad union with Shen, Zi, and Chen to create a treasury for wealth, symbolizing transformation from adversity to utility, predicting that the matter inquired will turn misfortune into fortune. Meanwhile, excessively strong robbery of wealth is high during the day and month, which is particularly unfavorable for timing; however, the changing hexagram encounters the Union of Six, fortuitously and transforms the Union of Six Si and Shen into Water, which appropriately represents the Wife/Fortune line. There is another symbol of gaining the Six Union's fortune. Additionally, the transition to the Union of Six in hexagrams often also signifies turning danger into safety.\n",

      "  \n",
      "This hexagram indicates strong and abundant information, showing that the transformations align with the querent's question. The imagery is sufficient, and both the primary and transforming hexagrams point to thriving financial resources. The favorable elements are strong, while the opposing elements are weak. The financial prospects are abundant, and wealth acquisition is effective. Receiving this hexagram suggests favorable financial fortune for the year. While it may not lead to great wealth, steady and gradual accumulation is possible. It is advised to control spending and patiently wait for better financial opportunities.  \n",

      "- Description: The Pi Hexagram: Success. There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  \t\t\n",
      "  \t\t\n",
      "The \"Image\" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Great Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Fortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Career: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Business: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Reputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Marriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Decision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.\n",
      "- Scholar Interpretation: Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one's capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one's capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.\n",

      "Let's analyze step by step to understand how the example interpretations were inferred from their respective hexagram information.\n",
      "\n",
      "<analyze>\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n",
      "   - The primary hexagram in Example 1 is \"Waiting (Nourishment)\" which advises patience and prudence. The emphasis is on strategic timing, avoiding impulsiveness. \n",
      "   - The interpretation mentions different elements such as \"Water\" related to finance/prosperity (Wife and Wealth line). \n",
      "   - There is an analysis of the hexagram's elements transformation, particularly noting the Brother line becomes less advantageous, transforming towards financial benefit. This transformation is significant since it correlates to a resolution from challenges leading to financial gain.\n",
      "   - The conclusion provided is similar to the primary hexagram’s essence—patient progression toward financial accumulation rather than immediate prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n",
      "   - The hexagram here is \"Innocence,\" highlighting the importance of integrity, suggesting a smooth journey without hidden dangers if actions are proper.\n",
      "   - The interpretation emphasizes the aspect of day-to-day steadiness as indicated by active lines and potential hurdles shown by line transformations.\n",
      "   - The analysis underlines the need to be cautious of smaller issues which might derail tasks, paralleling the hexagram’s cautionary essence of not deviating from true purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n",
      "   - The primary hexagram \"Grace\" represents nurturing and growth with some challenges. \n",
      "   - Financial prognosis in the interpretation utilizes the trend of wealth-related lines and the balance/composition of hexagram elements (siblings, wealth). Elements in harmony suggest gains.\n",
      "   - This case exemplifies how focusing on wealth lines within hexagrams conveys potential timing/paths for financial benefits aligning with ongoing challenges leading to eventual gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "</analyze>\n",
      "\n",
      "<reason>\n",
      "For the current query concerning financial fortune and using the \"Grace\" hexagram:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Elemental and Relational Dynamics:**\n",
      "   - The Wealth/Wife line represented by water (ji hai) in the third position plays a definitive role. As inferences align riches with the Water element, financial aspects naturally are reflected through Wife and Wealth lines.\n",
      "   - Line 5 transformation indicates potential obstacles will transform, representing eventual success, consistent with difficulties transitioning to smoother scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Interaction of Elements:**\n",
      "   - Interactions between elemental chains indicate potential opposition (demonstrated by sibling-Ke interactions), urging careful analytical behavior. This potential for competitive challenge highlights the necessity for vigilance concerning those elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Influences of Spirits and Sibling Lines:**\n",
      "   - Noteworthy scripture alludes to different spirits associated with lines, e.g., White Tiger, Black Tortoise. This indicates potential for transformative or calmer alteration respectively. The presence of these suggest unpredictable currents yet holds a favorable position once equilibrium (via action or approach alteration) is struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grace hexagram itself carries themes of apparent prosperity balanced by internal challenges. The surface illusion mentioned strongly recommends strategy in addressing real underlying issues. Maintain vigilance against potential illusions of success, ensuring efforts towards substantial growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, conclusions for a careful strategy are in order, cultivating financial strategies with painstaking care, sidestepping surface triumphs for more profound, lasting successes. With tact, financial gain can be expected given appropriate balancing of thematic elements inherent in the hexagram's structure.\n",

      "The \"Grace\" hexagram highlights a potential for financial benefits, though challenges are likely to be faced initially.

      "\n",
      "1. **Wealth Line Dynamics:**\n",
      "   - The wealth line, represented here by water elements in certain positions, implies opportunities for financial gain.

The transformation within the fifth position indicates that initial setbacks can eventually transition to smoother financial pathways.\n",

      "\n",
