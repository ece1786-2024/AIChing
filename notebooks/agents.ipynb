      "\t\t\n",
      "The Commentary on the Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Xun, representing wind; the lower trigram is Kan, representing water. Wind moving over water is the image of the Dispersion hexagram. The ancient kings observed this hexagram and thus offered sacrifices to the Heavenly Emperor, established ancestral temples, and promoted the moral teachings of revering heaven and honoring ancestors.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram portrays the combination of different trigrams with Water below and Wind above. Wind moves swiftly over water, assisting its force and spreading in all directions. This hexagram, called Disperse, signifies the scattering of water, symbolizing the dispersion of organizations and human hearts. It must be overcome with active means and methods to defeat drawbacks, rescue dispersal, and turn danger into safety. \t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "The Great Image: Wind blows over the water, spreading and dispersing. It is also like the spring breeze that dissipates the severe cold, causing ice and snow to melt.\t\t\n",

      "\t\t\n",
      "Career: You are in a relatively difficult position, primarily due to a lack of unity. Strong measures must be taken to seek stability and unity. Most importantly, adhere to the righteous path, maintain an impartial and selfless spirit, and earn people’s hearts to gather the dispersed.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Business: Market conditions are chaotic and directionless. Taking appropriate risks is absolutely necessary. One must be fair and selfless, restrain personal desires, and it is equally necessary to strive for powerful partners and support.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Pursuit of Fame: One must calm down, work hard to learn, and improve knowledge and skills. The situation of dispersal must be managed, requiring talent from various fields. The future is bright, with success depending crucially on individual effort.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Marriage and Relationships: As long as both parties hold pure intentions, success and happiness are inevitable.\t\t\n",
      "\t\t\n",
      "Decision Making: To advance one's career, positive means must be employed to overcome and conquer the maladies of internal discord. One must first eliminate selfishness, sacrifice the lesser self for the greater self, and avoid getting involved in disputes. By doing so, a stable situation can be regained, and in a favorable environment, the prospect of every undertaking is bright.\n",
      "- Scholar Interpretation: Dissolution dissipates disasters; seize the opportunity to observe changes and cultivate strength while preserving energy. For those who receive this hexagram, there may initially be difficulties, but ultimately problems can be resolved. It is advisable to be cautious in all matters to achieve success, and avoid reckless indulgence. \t\t\n",

      "## Hexagram Interpretation\n",
      "  \n",
      "To seek fame and position, one begins with the two spirits of father and official. If the official star does not appear in the hexagram, and the first line father suffers a daily break, then both spirits are ineffective. The upper line parents may be active, but they transform into wealth, causing conflict and suppression, resulting in the parents, though active, being weakened by the daily break and further damaged by transformation. The use spirit is weak and gravely damaged, indicating the hexagram is already unfavorable. When the overall image shows misfortune, examine the host line for any remedies. In the primary hexagram, the host line is held by brothers, which is inauspicious for exams. This is because brothers represent peers and competition is strong when brothers are in a thriving position, thus making it disadvantageous for exams. Furthermore, the brothers drain the parents’ spirit, with both parents’ lines in motion due to the brothers' influence. The brothers further drain the already disrupted and weakened parents, increasing their weakness, leading to an even weaker use spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, observe the relationship between the host and the responder lines: brothers holding the host give birth to the offspring responder line, which clashes with the official ghost spirit. There is no finance star to bridge the gap, similar to a strong injury official without wealth in the four pillars Bazi, making the hexagram structure unfavorable for seeing the official star. The subject's inquiry involves the use of spirit, official, and seal, yet the official and seal in the hexagram are weak while the injury official is strong, making it undesirable to see the official. When the spirit becomes a taboo spirit, the pattern inevitably fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examining the hexagram imagery: the hexagram encounters a reversed chant, indicating more misfortune than fortune. In this primary hexagram, the two most crucial lines— the parents’ spirit line transforms into a reversed chant caused by conflict, and the host line further transforms into a reversed chant. In the context of exams, smooth progress is desired, whereas an abundance of dreams signifies challenges. The repeated presence of reversed chants, with the two most vital core spirit lines being disrupted, spells more misfortune than fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the Six Spirits: Although the auspicious Azure Dragon governs the parents’ line, suggesting fortune, it is inactive and suffers a daily break, rendering it powerless. The brothers’ ominous spirit governs the host line, is in motion, and occupies the White Tiger position, indicating that peers gain power while disadvantaging oneself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it concerns academic advancement, let's consider the most vital deities associated with studies: Jia Wood Day's Wenchang and Wenqu occupy Si and You. The Wenchang star governs the host but is conflicted again and situated with the brothers. When the Sun Wenchang shines brightly on peers, it becomes disadvantageous to oneself.\n",
      "## Answer\n",
      "  \n",
      "Recent opportunities for promotion are limited, and waiting for the right moment is recommended. Additionally, the hexagram shows a favorable interaction between the external factor and the self, suggesting benefits from collaborating with others. It indicates that a collaborator, possibly a senior or superior, may assist in personal growth. This person can be considered a benefactor. Maintaining a good relationship with this collaborator is crucial, as it may lead to positive outcomes in the future, though such benefits might not be immediately visible. Over time, when conditions improve, the results may become apparent.  \n",

      "    ('\\n\\n\\n\\n# \\n\\n## Hexagram Information\\n\\n## Primary Hexagram: Darkening of the Light\\n\\n### General Information\\n\\n- Description: Ming Yi Hexagram: It is beneficial to consult about difficult matters.  \\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" commentary says: The inner trigram of this hexagram is Li, representing the sun, while the outer trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The sun setting into the earth is the image of the Ming Yi hexagram. The noble person observes this hexagram image and governs the people not by harsh scrutiny as clarity, but by appearing outwardly foolish while being wise within, accommodating things and being close to the masses.\\n- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the superposition of two different trigrams, Li (below) and Kun (above). Li represents brightness, and Kun represents compliance; Li symbolizes the sun, and Kun symbolizes the earth. The sun sets into the earth, resulting in diminished brightness and an uncertain future, suggesting a challenging environment. It is advised to bide your time while obscuring one\\'s brilliance, adhere firmly to the correct path, appear outwardly simple while being inwardly wise, and conceal one\\'s talents and capabilities.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nGreat Image: The sun is obscured beneath the Kun earth, the earth is dark, symbolizing blindness.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFortune: Many things are obstructed, and small-minded people may cause harm. When faced with perplexing situations, it is advisable to remain still and wait for the right opportunity to act.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nCareer: In an unfavorable environment, it\\'s best to deal with adverse conditions calmly, enhance mental resilience, and endure various pressures. Appear gentle and cautious outwardly, while being insightful and understanding inwardly. When it is time to depart, do so to avoid disaster and escape danger. Prevent problems before they emerge and persist in striving amid adversity.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nBusiness: Carefully observe market trends, wait for the right moment to act, while adhering to business ethics. Even when in adverse circumstances, have the courage to move forward, especially in developing southward, which will yield great rewards.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nPursuit of Fame: Maintain a grand ambition at heart, and act with diligence and endurance, striving amid adversity. Adhere to one\\'s ideals, hide intelligence without revealing it, and in chaos, it is even more essential to uphold justice and remain unpretentious and discreet.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nMarriage and Relationships: A comprehensive analysis of the other party\\'s situation is necessary; one must not lose more by taking small gains. Pay attention to the overall situation.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nDecision Making: When in poor conditions where the environment is tough and the future is unclear, if one can handle misfortune calmly, be both flexible and firm, the future will become bright. Particularly, one should enhance personal development, practice patience with determination, appear outwardly unassuming while being wise within, and find fortune in difficulties. By being cautious and careful in all matters, one can achieve success.\\n- Scholar Interpretation: The sun sets beneath the earth, the brightness is harmed; all things are obstructed and await their time.  \\t\\t\\nThose who receive this hexagram have unfavorable fortunes and labor in all matters. It is advisable to uphold righteousness, endure, and wait for the opportunity.  \\t\\t\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong:  \\t\\t\\nTiming and fortune: Be wise and maintain integrity to avoid disaster.  \\t\\t\\nFinancial prospects: There are no apparent profits, but there is a hidden sharing of benefits.  \\t\\t\\nHousehold: It is advisable for father and son to live separately; marriages are not arranged formally.  \\t\\t\\nHealth: The liver is engorged and stagnant, so be mindful of maintaining it.  \\n\\n### Line Information\\n\\n- Line 1\\n    - Description: At the beginning of nine: \"The pelican is soaring, resting by the marsh\\'s edge. The noble man leaves home, spending three days without provisions.\" Divining this line means that if one goes somewhere, they will surely face the host\\'s reproach. The Commentary on the Image says: A noble man on a journey cannot disgrace himself by accepting food against propriety.\\n    - Element: ji mao wood, Relation: None, \\n    - Spirit: Black Tortoise\\n    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying\\n\\n- Line 2\\n    - Description: Six in the second place: The pelican, the pelican, is injured on the left thigh. The noble man is wounded but is rescued because of the horse. It is auspicious.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe commentary says:\\n    - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: None, \\n    - Spirit: Azure Dragon\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Nine in the second place: Those who follow the path, they are open-minded; those who live in seclusion, they often encounter auspicious signs. The Commentary on the Image says: Those who live in seclusion maintain purity and integrity because their nature is upright and not swayed by worldly temptations.\\n        - Element: ding mao wood, Relation: None\\n\\n- Line 3\\n    - Description: Nine in the third position: In the hunting grounds in the south, drawing the bow and shooting arrows, gaining some large wild beasts. When this line appears in divination, it is unfavorable when inquiring about illnesses. The Image Commentary says: Determination in hunting in the south greatly fulfills one\\'s intentions.\\n    - Element: ji hai water, Relation: Sibling, \\n    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Line three: Attempting to see when one is blind, or to walk when one is lame, is an effort beyond one\\'s capacity, akin to stepping on a tiger\\'s tail, which will eventually lead to injury by the tiger. This is a perilous situation. When a warrior seizes governmental power, it is similarly dangerous. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe commentary says: Attempting to see when one is blind signifies a lack of vision sufficient to discern objects. Attempting to walk when one is lame signifies a lack of strength sufficient to travel. A tiger injures because line three has a yin line occupying a yang position, which is inappropriate. When a warrior seizes governmental power, it is a case of overstepping one\\'s bounds by adopting the ambitions of the position above, represented by the line three occupying the ambitions of line five, inevitably leading to disaster.\\n        - Element: ding chou soil, Relation: None\\n\\n- Line 4\\n    - Description: Six in the fourth place: Return to a place of deep retreat! Stepping out from the room and into society, one feels the perilous nature of the surroundings, and the desire to withdraw naturally arises.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Returning to a place of deep retreat fulfills the intention of withdrawal.\\n    - Element: gui chou soil, Relation: None, \\n    - Spirit: Hook Snake\\n    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Stepping on the tail of a tiger, yet being able to recognize danger and fear, ultimately leading to good fortune.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image states: Fear and vigilance ultimately lead to good fortune, indicating that although one has experienced difficulties, their aspirations can still be fulfilled.\\n        - Element: ren wu fire, Relation: None\\n\\n- Line 5\\n    - Description: Nine in the fifth place: After the fall of the Yin Dynasty, Jizi fled to a neighboring country in the east to take refuge and received an auspicious omen through divination.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Jizi\\'s withdrawal and steadfastness in upholding righteousness ensured that his glorious image remains bright for a thousand ages.\\n    - Element: gui hai water, Relation: Sibling, \\n    - Spirit: Flying Serpent\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Nine in the Fifth Position: Acting hastily and rashly; divination shows signs of danger in actions.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Xiangci commentary states: Acting hastily and rashly, divination shows signs of danger in actions, but since the yang line of the Nine in the Fifth Position is rightly placed in the upper trigram, it is appropriate in its position. Therefore, though there is danger, it is not calamitous.\\n        - Element: ren shen gold, Relation: None\\n\\n- Line 6\\n    - Description: Sixty-five: After the fall of the Yin dynasty, Ji Zi fled to a neighboring country in the east to seek refuge and sought divination, receiving auspicious omens.

Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Top Nine: Act prudently and consider matters thoroughly and repeatedly, great fortune.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Great fortune and auspiciousness, because the Top Nine line is at the head of the entire hexagram.

      "### Primary Hexagram: Darkening of the Light (Ming Yi)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### General Interpretation\n",
      "The hexagram Darkening of the Light (Ming Yi) consists of the trigrams Li (Inner, representing Fire) and Kun (Outer, representing Earth). This structure symbolizes the setting sun disappearing beneath the earth, indicating a period of obscurity or adversity where one's brightness and talents are concealed. The core advice of this hexagram is to navigate challenges with wisdom and integrity, maintaining vigilance while appearing outwardly modest. It suggests caution during unfavorable conditions, advocating strategic retreat or concealment until circumstances improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Five Elements\n",
      "- **Li (Fire)** within **Kun (Earth)**: Fire over Earth in the Five Element cycle suggests a diminishing phase for Light (Fire), which is both supported and contained by Earth.

I came here to ask for my fortune.\\n    First, please allow me to provide you some examples.\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n# Example 1\\n\\n## Question: Will my salary increase after starting the new job?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# \\n\\n## Hexagram Information\\n\\n## Primary Hexagram: Dispersion\\n\\n### General Information\\n\\n- Description: Dispersion: Success, as the king personally attends the ancestral temple to avert disasters and pray for blessings. It is beneficial to cross rivers and streams. This is an auspicious divination.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Xun, representing wind; the lower trigram is Kan, representing water. Wind moving over water is the image of the Dispersion hexagram. The ancient kings observed this hexagram and thus offered sacrifices to the Heavenly Emperor, established ancestral temples, and promoted the moral teachings of revering heaven and honoring ancestors.\\n- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram portrays the combination of different trigrams with Water below and Wind above. Wind moves swiftly over water, assisting its force and spreading in all directions. This hexagram, called Disperse, signifies the scattering of water, symbolizing the dispersion of organizations and human hearts. It must be overcome with active means and methods to defeat drawbacks, rescue dispersal, and turn danger into safety. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Great Image: Wind blows over the water, spreading and dispersing. It is also like the spring breeze that dissipates the severe cold, causing ice and snow to melt.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFortunes: Although there are worries, difficulties can ultimately be resolved, and all endeavors will prosper. Avoid capriciousness and sluggishness.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nCareer: You are in a relatively difficult position, primarily due to a lack of unity. Strong measures must be taken to seek stability and unity. Most importantly, adhere to the righteous path, maintain an impartial and selfless spirit, and earn people’s hearts to gather the dispersed.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nBusiness: Market conditions are chaotic and directionless. Taking appropriate risks is absolutely necessary. One must be fair and selfless, restrain personal desires, and it is equally necessary to strive for powerful partners and support.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nPursuit of Fame: One must calm down, work hard to learn, and improve knowledge and skills. The situation of dispersal must be managed, requiring talent from various fields. The future is bright, with success depending crucially on individual effort.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nMarriage and Relationships: As long as both parties hold pure intentions, success and happiness are inevitable.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nDecision Making: To advance one\\'s career, positive means must be employed to overcome and conquer the maladies of internal discord. One must first eliminate selfishness, sacrifice the lesser self for the greater self, and avoid getting involved in disputes. By doing so, a stable situation can be regained, and in a favorable environment, the prospect of every undertaking is bright.\\n- Scholar Interpretation: Dissolution dissipates disasters; seize the opportunity to observe changes and cultivate strength while preserving energy. For those who receive this hexagram, there may initially be difficulties, but ultimately problems can be resolved. It is advisable to be cautious in all matters to achieve success, and avoid reckless indulgence. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFate: Opportunities will turn in your favor, naturally advancing your situation. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFinance: Divine blessings and smooth financial flow. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nHome: Pray for blessings and form a good match naturally. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nHealth: The illness is severe, likely beyond recovery.\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n### Line Information\\n\\n- Line 1\\n    - Description: The first line: When a flood suddenly arrives, one escapes by riding a horse, hastily and with injuries, yet narrowly avoiding the calamity of drowning, this is fortunate.

All important personnel have already been evacuated, resulting in no major disaster.  \\t\\t\\nThe \\'Image\\' text says: The royal palace did not encounter disaster because the ninth position in the fifth place is the yang line residing in the middle position of the upper trigram, with a position that is both noble and correct, naturally avoiding disaster.\\n    - Element: xin si fire, Relation: Sibling, \\n    - Spirit: Hook Snake\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Six in the fifth place: When hunting, prey is obtained; in battle, captives are taken; there is no calamity. The eldest son commands the army, while the second son is defeated and perishes on the battlefield. This is an ominous omen of divination.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Xiangci says: The eldest son commands the army, which is in accordance with the proper way. The second son is defeated and perishes because the delegation of duties was improper.\\n        - Element: gui hai water, Relation: None\\n\\n- Line 6\\n    - Description: Top Nine: The flood has receded, and troubles are eliminated, but one must remain vigilant and enhance precautions; thus, there will be no disaster.

Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Top line: The ruler issues an order, someone is granted the rank of a noble, enjoying a fiefdom, someone is granted the rank of a minister, enjoying a land estate. However, do not employ people who lack talent and virtue.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Commentary says: The ruler issues a decree to reward meritorious officials, this is to reward and recognize accomplishments. Do not employ people who lack talent and virtue, because such people will inevitably bring ruin and chaos to the nation.\\n        - Element: gui you gold, Relation: None\\n\\n## Hexagram Interpretation\\n  \\nTo seek fame and position, one begins with the two spirits of father and official. If the official star does not appear in the hexagram, and the first line father suffers a daily break, then both spirits are ineffective. The upper line parents may be active, but they transform into wealth, causing conflict and suppression, resulting in the parents, though active, being weakened by the daily break and further damaged by transformation. The use spirit is weak and gravely damaged, indicating the hexagram is already unfavorable. When the overall image shows misfortune, examine the host line for any remedies. In the primary hexagram, the host line is held by brothers, which is inauspicious for exams. This is because brothers represent peers and competition is strong when brothers are in a thriving position, thus making it disadvantageous for exams. Furthermore, the brothers drain the parents’ spirit, with both parents’ lines in motion due to the brothers\\' influence. The brothers further drain the already disrupted and weakened parents, increasing their weakness, leading to an even weaker use spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, observe the relationship between the host and the responder lines: brothers holding the host give birth to the offspring responder line, which clashes with the official ghost spirit. There is no finance star to bridge the gap, similar to a strong injury official without wealth in the four pillars Bazi, making the hexagram structure unfavorable for seeing the official star. The subject\\'s inquiry involves the use of spirit, official, and seal, yet the official and seal in the hexagram are weak while the injury official is strong, making it undesirable to see the official. When the spirit becomes a taboo spirit, the pattern inevitably fails.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamining the hexagram imagery: the hexagram encounters a reversed chant, indicating more misfortune than fortune. In this primary hexagram, the two most crucial lines— the parents’ spirit line transforms into a reversed chant caused by conflict, and the host line further transforms into a reversed chant. In the context of exams, smooth progress is desired, whereas an abundance of dreams signifies challenges. The repeated presence of reversed chants, with the two most vital core spirit lines being disrupted, spells more misfortune than fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the Six Spirits: Although the auspicious Azure Dragon governs the parents’ line, suggesting fortune, it is inactive and suffers a daily break, rendering it powerless. The brothers’ ominous spirit governs the host line, is in motion, and occupies the White Tiger position, indicating that peers gain power while disadvantaging oneself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it concerns academic advancement, let\\'s consider the most vital deities associated with studies: Jia Wood Day\\'s Wenchang and Wenqu occupy Si and You. The Wenchang star governs the host but is conflicted again and situated with the brothers. When the Sun Wenchang shines brightly on peers, it becomes disadvantageous to oneself.\\n## Answer\\n  \\nRecent opportunities for promotion are limited, and waiting for the right moment is recommended. Additionally, the hexagram shows a favorable interaction between the external factor and the self, suggesting benefits from collaborating with others. It indicates that a collaborator, possibly a senior or superior, may assist in personal growth. This person can be considered a benefactor. Maintaining a good relationship with this collaborator is crucial, as it may lead to positive outcomes in the future, though such benefits might not be immediately visible. Over time, when conditions improve, the results may become apparent.  \\n\\n    Here\\'s the information about the hexagram(s) I got:\\n    (\\'\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n## Hexagram Information\\\\n\\\\n## Primary Hexagram: Darkening of the Light\\\\n\\\\n### General Information\\\\n\\\\n- Description: Ming Yi Hexagram: It is beneficial to consult about difficult matters.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe \"Image\" commentary says: The inner trigram of this hexagram is Li, representing the sun, while the outer trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The sun setting into the earth is the image of the Ming Yi hexagram. The noble person observes this hexagram image and governs the people not by harsh scrutiny as clarity, but by appearing outwardly foolish while being wise within, accommodating things and being close to the masses.\\\\n- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the superposition of two different trigrams, Li (below) and Kun (above). Li represents brightness, and Kun represents compliance; Li symbolizes the sun, and Kun symbolizes the earth. The sun sets into the earth, resulting in diminished brightness and an uncertain future, suggesting a challenging environment. It is advised to bide your time while obscuring one\\\\\\'s brilliance, adhere firmly to the correct path, appear outwardly simple while being inwardly wise, and conceal one\\\\\\'s talents and capabilities.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nGreat Image: The sun is obscured beneath the Kun earth, the earth is dark, symbolizing blindness.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nFortune: Many things are obstructed, and small-minded people may cause harm. When faced with perplexing situations, it is advisable to remain still and wait for the right opportunity to act.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nCareer: In an unfavorable environment, it\\\\\\'s best to deal with adverse conditions calmly, enhance mental resilience, and endure various pressures. Appear gentle and cautious outwardly, while being insightful and understanding inwardly. When it is time to depart, do so to avoid disaster and escape danger. Prevent problems before they emerge and persist in striving amid adversity.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nBusiness: Carefully observe market trends, wait for the right moment to act, while adhering to business ethics. Even when in adverse circumstances, have the courage to move forward, especially in developing southward, which will yield great rewards.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nPursuit of Fame: Maintain a grand ambition at heart, and act with diligence and endurance, striving amid adversity. Adhere to one\\\\\\'s ideals, hide intelligence without revealing it, and in chaos, it is even more essential to uphold justice and remain unpretentious and discreet.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nMarriage and Relationships: A comprehensive analysis of the other party\\\\\\'s situation is necessary; one must not lose more by taking small gains. Pay attention to the overall situation.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nDecision Making: When in poor conditions where the environment is tough and the future is unclear, if one can handle misfortune calmly, be both flexible and firm, the future will become bright. Particularly, one should enhance personal development, practice patience with determination, appear outwardly unassuming while being wise within, and find fortune in difficulties. By being cautious and careful in all matters, one can achieve success.\\\\n- Scholar Interpretation: The sun sets beneath the earth, the brightness is harmed; all things are obstructed and await their time.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThose who receive this hexagram have unfavorable fortunes and labor in all matters. It is advisable to uphold righteousness, endure, and wait for the opportunity.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong:  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nTiming and fortune: Be wise and maintain integrity to avoid disaster.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nFinancial prospects: There are no apparent profits, but there is a hidden sharing of benefits.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nHousehold: It is advisable for father and son to live separately; marriages are not arranged formally.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nHealth: The liver is engorged and stagnant, so be mindful of maintaining it.  \\\\n\\\\n### Line Information\\\\n\\\\n- Line 1\\\\n    - Description: At the beginning of nine: \"The pelican is soaring, resting by the marsh\\\\\\'s edge. The noble man leaves home, spending three days without provisions.\" Divining this line means that if one goes somewhere, they will surely face the host\\\\\\'s reproach. The Commentary on the Image says: A noble man on a journey cannot disgrace himself by accepting food against propriety.\\\\n    - Element: ji mao wood, Relation: None, \\\\n    - Spirit: Black Tortoise\\\\n    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying\\\\n\\\\n- Line 2\\\\n    - Description: Six in the second place: The pelican, the pelican, is injured on the left thigh. The noble man is wounded but is rescued because of the horse. It is auspicious.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe commentary says:\\\\n    - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: None, \\\\n    - Spirit: Azure Dragon\\\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\\\n        - Description: Nine in the second place: Those who follow the path, they are open-minded; those who live in seclusion, they often encounter auspicious signs. The Commentary on the Image says: Those who live in seclusion maintain purity and integrity because their nature is upright and not swayed by worldly temptations.\\\\n        - Element: ding mao wood, Relation: None\\\\n\\\\n- Line 3\\\\n    - Description: Nine in the third position: In the hunting grounds in the south, drawing the bow and shooting arrows, gaining some large wild beasts. When this line appears in divination, it is unfavorable when inquiring about illnesses. The Image Commentary says: Determination in hunting in the south greatly fulfills one\\\\\\'s intentions.\\\\n    - Element: ji hai water, Relation: Sibling, \\\\n    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird\\\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\\\n        - Description: Line three: Attempting to see when one is blind, or to walk when one is lame, is an effort beyond one\\\\\\'s capacity, akin to stepping on a tiger\\\\\\'s tail, which will eventually lead to injury by the tiger. This is a perilous situation. When a warrior seizes governmental power, it is similarly dangerous. \\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe commentary says: Attempting to see when one is blind signifies a lack of vision sufficient to discern objects. Attempting to walk when one is lame signifies a lack of strength sufficient to travel. A tiger injures because line three has a yin line occupying a yang position, which is inappropriate. When a warrior seizes governmental power, it is a case of overstepping one\\\\\\'s bounds by adopting the ambitions of the position above, represented by the line three occupying the ambitions of line five, inevitably leading to disaster.\\\\n        - Element: ding chou soil, Relation: None\\\\n\\\\n- Line 4\\\\n    - Description: Six in the fourth place: Return to a place of deep retreat! Stepping out from the room and into society, one feels the perilous nature of the surroundings, and the desire to withdraw naturally arises.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Returning to a place of deep retreat fulfills the intention of withdrawal.\\\\n    - Element: gui chou soil, Relation: None, \\\\n    - Spirit: Hook Snake\\\\n    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi\\\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\\\n        - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Stepping on the tail of a tiger, yet being able to recognize danger and fear, ultimately leading to good fortune.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe Commentary on the Image states: Fear and vigilance ultimately lead to good fortune, indicating that although one has experienced difficulties, their aspirations can still be fulfilled.\\\\n        - Element: ren wu fire, Relation: None\\\\n\\\\n- Line 5\\\\n    - Description: Nine in the fifth place: After the fall of the Yin Dynasty, Jizi fled to a neighboring country in the east to take refuge and received an auspicious omen through divination.  \\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Jizi\\\\\\'s withdrawal and steadfastness in upholding righteousness ensured that his glorious image remains bright for a thousand ages.\\\\n    - Element: gui hai water, Relation: Sibling, \\\\n    - Spirit: Flying Serpent\\\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\\\n        - Description: Nine in the Fifth Position: Acting hastily and rashly; divination shows signs of danger in actions.\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\nThe Xiangci commentary states: Acting hastily and rashly, divination shows signs of danger in actions, but since the yang line of the Nine in the Fifth Position is rightly placed in the upper trigram, it is appropriate in its position. Therefore, though there is danger, it is not calamitous.\\\\n        - Element: ren shen gold, Relation: None\\\\n\\\\n- Line 6\\\\n    - Description: Sixty-five: After the fall of the Yin dynasty, Ji Zi fled to a neighboring country in the east to seek refuge and sought divination, receiving auspicious omens.

This structure symbolizes the setting sun disappearing beneath the earth, indicating a period of obscurity or adversity where one's brightness and talents are concealed. The core advice of this hexagram is to navigate challenges with wisdom and integrity, maintaining vigilance while appearing outwardly modest. It suggests caution during unfavorable conditions, advocating strategic retreat or concealment until circumstances improve.\\n\\n#### Five Elements\\n- **Li (Fire)** within **Kun (Earth)**: Fire over Earth in the Five Element cycle suggests a diminishing phase for Light (Fire), which is both supported and contained by Earth. Rather than explicit opposition, it's more of a protective phase, advising patience until Fire (Light/Insight) can rise again.\\n  \\n#### Six Relatives & Relationships\\n- Most lines emphasize caution and patience, focusing on the potentially restrictive yet grounding influence of Earth over Fire. The protective stance of the hexagram advises waiting and preparation, despite competition or challenge symbolized by Siblings and Peers.\\n\\n#### Six Divine Beings\\n- The Divine Beings associated with each line suggest a blend of caution (Black Tortoise, Hook Snake) and potential positive energy (Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird). The presence of multiple Divine Beings relating to alertness and adaptability further underscores the need for thoughtful contemplation.\\n\\n### Lines and Transitions\\n\\n- **Line 1**: Suggests taking initiative despite obstacles but advises staying true to one's principles.\\n- **Line 2**: Injured by circumstances but rescue or help is near. Transition to openness and integrity is emphasized, indicating a possible shift towards favorable outcomes, especially when aligning with correct conduct.\\n- **Line 3**: Pursuit of goals might seem beyond reach initially, warning against risk-taking in volatile circumstances; however, a retreat to focus on core values is indicated in the changed structure.\\n- **Line 4**: Implies tension or adversity, urging tactful withdrawal or inward focus; the changing line suggests danger awareness and conscientious behavior leading to eventual good fortune.\\n- **Line 5**: Counsel on a hasty retreat from adverse circumstances.
