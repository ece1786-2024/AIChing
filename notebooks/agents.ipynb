For those who receive this hexagram, the way forward is blocked, and rash advancement is inadvisable.

Gen signifies the mountain, and the two mountains overlap, symbolizing stillness. It is the opposite of the Zhen hexagram. After a climax, a low tide inevitably follows, entering a relatively static phase of things. Being still as a mountain, if it is appropriate to stop, then stop; if it is appropriate to move, then move. Moving and stopping, that is, action and stillness, should coincide with the opportunity and should be well-managed, moving and being still appropriately, and stopping appropriately.\\n\\nImage: Two towering mountains stand side by side, hence it is better to stop than to advance; it is an image of obstruction.\\n\\nFortunes: Avoid reckless actions in all matters, as the path ahead is blocked and one can only act when the opportunity arises.\\n\\nCareer: After a period of development, adjustments should be made, and actions temporarily paused to summarize experiences and lessons. Do not advance recklessly out of greed for fame and profit. Exercise self-restraint and self-discipline, speak and act prudently, and do not blindly pursue others. After rest and adjustment, when the right opportunity comes, display great skills.\\n\\nBusiness: Entering a stagnant state, one should not recklessly advance, but pause appropriately, retreating quietly and not being disturbed by external influences. It is especially important to maintain inner peace and rationality, and not to easily collaborate with others. Wait for the right opportunity, and there will be a bright future.\\n\\nSeeking Fame: Maintain a pure purpose and steadfastly adhere to the right path. Do not be tempted by fame and fortune. By upholding honesty and loyalty, success can be achieved.\\n\\nMarriage: Value feelings deeply and treat each other with sincerity, and you can grow old together.\\n\\nDecision Making: With a calm and introverted personality, not fond of activities and not good at socializing, being loyal and honest, and valuing faithfulness. Pay attention to listening to others' suggestions and maintain prudence for self-preservation. When opportunities have not arrived, it is best not to be overly active; stop when necessary and do not harbor unrealistic ideas.\", 'philosophy': 'The hexagram of Gen, symbolizing the mountain hexagram.\\n\\nGen represents the mountain. In the I Ching, the symbol for the Gen hexagram is two broken lines below a solid line. This symbol originates from the ancient observation that mountains are made of stones of varying sizes. Therefore, two broken lines, or \"yin\" lines, represent the unevenly sized stones on a high mountain. From bottom to top, the highest layer is depicted as an undulating mountain peak, drawn with a single solid \"yang\" line, thus forming the symbol of the mountain.\\n\\nThe form of the \"Gen\" hexagram has a yang line situated above two yin lines, resembling the top of a mountain being yang, under which yin elements lie hidden. Since mountains are always still and unmoving, the nature of \"Gen\" is to \"stop.\" The symbolic meanings it represents include prohibition, obstruction, stillness, boundary, composure, calmness, alternation, stubbornness, subjectivity, new beginnings, standard, independence, transformation, litigation, sincerity, extinction, exhortation, waiting, and weightiness.\\n\\nThe lesson imparted by the Gen hexagram is that movement and stillness should be timely. It is classified among the lower middle hexagrams, and \"The Image\" interprets this hexagram as follows: Wealth often comes to mind, but sadly it is hard to grasp at present. When things do not go as planned, one should endure patiently and refrain from speaking out on idle matters.'}, 'line_1': {'description': 'At the beginning six: Stopping at the feet, no blame.

It is also not in the central position, meaning it cannot maintain balance. This line suggests that deviations appear at the initial stage of actions.\\n\\nThe \"Image\" section explains this line as: \"Stopping at the toes ensures no loss of correctness.\" It points out: \"If you realize a mistake before taking a step, you should stop immediately,\" which demonstrates that the right path has not been lost, thus preventing errors.\\n\\nFor those who receive this line in divination, you intend to do something, but the current situation is unpredictable.

The meaning of this Yao text is: Restraint at the calves, since one is unable to rescue others, one has to follow along with them, feeling uneasy at heart.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the second line is a Yin line occupying a yielding position, properly positioned and holding the center, embodying the virtues of balance and harmony. Line two, along with line three and line four, forms the Kan Hexagram, which represents danger. Line two, being at the beginning of the Kan Hexagram, is the first to become aware of this danger, but its superior, line three, cannot maintain the center, being masculine and aggressive without considering the consequences. Line two wants to dissuade line three\\'s actions, but its position is lower than that of line three, much like how a person\\'s calf cannot control the thigh. Line two cannot deter line three and can only reluctantly follow.\\n\\nThe commentary in the Image section analyzes this line: \"Unable to rescue those who follow,\" as they have not retreated to listen. Here it points out: \"Since one is unable to rescue others, one has to follow along with them,\" because line three cannot retreat to listen to the advice of restraint, thus line two feels uneasy.\\n\\nFor someone who divines this line, you have become aware of the existence of a certain danger, but your superior or leader does not heed your advice, and you must take the risk with them. At this time, it indeed feels very helpless. \\n\\nLine two: Restrain the calves, unable to rescue those who follow, the heart feels uneasy.

Explanation of the Line Statement: Boundary refers to the limit. Splitting means separating, listed but not connected. Spine refers to the human spine, positioned opposite the heart. The meaning of this line statement is: Restraining the movement of the waist to the extent of tearing the flesh on the back, causing personal danger and heartfelt distress. From the Hexagram image, nine in the third belongs to a yang line in a firm position, gaining position but not centered, easily impatient and moving. Nine in the third is in the middle of Kan hexagram, constituted by six in the second, nine in the third, and six in the fourth. Kan hexagram indicates danger. Nine in the third is in danger, without assistance, and unable to move by itself. It is like taking a step onto the threshold and then remembering to restrain one\\'s movement; such restraint is actually uncontrollable, it will tear the flesh on the spine. Doing this is very fierce, it feels as uncomfortable as blazing fire troubling the heart. The commentary in the Image says: \"Restrain at the boundary,\" peril troubling the heart. It points out: \"Restraining the movement of the waist,\" signifies being in peril with heartfelt distress. The lesson this line conveys is: Act when it\\'s time to act, stop when it\\'s time to stop, but if the timing and position for stopping are inappropriate, it can cause unnecessary loss. Those who obtain this line, due to being unable to withstand work pressure and not resigning in time, might face problems in the waist. Those who obtain this line might also, out of greed for fame or profit, wish to wholeheartedly help others to achieve their goals, but at dusk end up in conflict with others, at this point, one must stop what they are doing and should not let greed for profit lead them to demand benefits from others. Nine in the third: Restrain at the boundary, splitting the spine, peril involved, troubling the heart. The Image says: Restrain at the boundary, peril troubling the heart. The text means: Stop the waist, tear the spine, danger burns the heart like fire. The commentary in the Image means: Stop the waist, the danger burns the heart like fire.'}, 'line_4': {'description': \"Six in the fourth place: Keeping still like a mountain in one's own body, there is no blame.\\n\\nThe Image says: Keeping still like a mountain in one's own body signifies stopping oneself.\", 'interpretation': \"Six in the fourth place: Retreat to safeguard oneself, there is no disaster.  \\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Retreat to safeguard oneself indicates that the person's attention is fully concentrated on their own safety, thus avoiding calamity.\", 'scholar_interpretation': \"Flat: Those who receive this line should maintain their position and adhere to the norm, avoiding any unrealistic ambitions.\\n\\nInterpretation by Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese classical learning:\\n\\nFortunes: There are neither gains nor losses, but staying within one's bounds avoids blame.\\n\\nFinancial luck: One can preserve their capital and encounter other good opportunities.\\n\\nHousehold: Peaceful and untroubled; marriage remains average.\\n\\nHealth: Prolongs life despite illness.\", 'philosophy': 'Hexagram Gen, Fourth Line: The Yao Text reads: \"Holding back oneself, no misfortune.\"\\n\\nThe meaning of this Yao Text is: Restraining the upper body from movement will prevent harm.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fourth line has already entered the upper trigram, close to the noble position of the fifth line, akin to a minister near the sovereign. This position resembles the chest and abdomen of the body, protecting vital organs, while controlling the limbs. The fourth line is a yin line in a soft position, correctly aligned with its place. It can curtail the rash impulses of the third line and maintain introspection and self-control while following the orders of the fifth line, thus avoiding misfortune.\\n\\nIn the \"Image,\" the analysis of this line is: \"Holding back oneself\" means to stop it upon the body, indicating self-restraint without exceeding one’s position.\\n\\nThis line advises people that everything has a measure, and it is crucial to consider this when doing things. Those who receive this line in an omen should understand the key issue is to manage this measure well, ensuring both subordinates\\' actions and their self-reflection are within bounds, particularly in the proper execution of a leader’s orders. You can examine whether you have made any mistakes or errors in these aspects.'}, 'line_5': {'description': 'Nine in the fifth position: Restrain the jaws, words have order, regret vanishes.  \\nThe Image says: Restrain the jaws to be moderate and correct.', 'interpretation': \"Nine in the fifth place: Keep one's mouth closed and speak sparingly, speak with measure and naturally, there will be no regret. The commentary on the image says: Keeping one's mouth closed and speaking sparingly with measure results in no regret because the nine in the fifth place occupies a central position in the upper trigram, resembling a person who adheres to the path of moderation and rectitude.\", 'scholar_interpretation': 'Tranquility: Those who receive this line are righteous and virtuous individuals; human relations are harmonious, and aspirations are fulfilled.

Explanation of the line statement: \"Cheeks\" refers to the sides of the face. \"Words are orderly\" means speaking with moderation and having structure in speech. The meaning of this line statement is: Restrain one\\'s mouth and avoid speaking recklessly; speak with moderation and organization. From the perspective of the hexagram\\'s image, the sixth line in the fifth place, being a yin line in a sovereign position, suggests a lack of balance due to its gentle nature. However, it occupies the middle of the upper trigram, suggesting adherence to the middle path and effectively restraining one’s speech and behavior. Words spoken in this manner are considered precious, and thus, there will be no occasion for regret. The \"Image\" section interprets this line: \"Restraining the cheeks\" is due to following the middle path. It indicates that \"restraining one\\'s mouth and avoiding reckless speech\" shows that the six in the fifth place occupies a central position and can maintain the middle way. This line teaches the principle of being cautious as trouble often follows careless speech. Those who draw this line in divination may be particularly fond of talking, with some even exaggerating or boasting, which can cause resentment among those around them. It is essential to be mindful while speaking, as excessive words can lead to mistakes; avoid saying things that shouldn\\'t be said to prevent unnecessary trouble. Exercise caution in both speech and actions; if you do not involve yourself once a major issue arises, you will not have regrets.'}, 'line_6': {'description': 'Top Nine.

Officials will be promoted, and scholars will achieve excellent results.\\n\\nFu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese Chinese studies, interprets it as:\\n\\nFortune: Ever improving, naturally auspicious.\\nWealth: Profitable business, substantial gains.\\nHome: Generations of integrity; marriage is blessed.\\nHealth: Robust constitution.', 'philosophy': 'Hexagram Gen, Line Six: Six at the Top: Steadfast restraint, auspicious.\\n\\nExplanation: Dun refers to teaching and being steadfast and substantial. The meaning of this line is that one can use steadfast and genuine virtues to suppress wrongful desires, thus achieving auspiciousness. From the perspective of the hexagram\\'s form, the six at the top is situated at the highest point of the Gen hexagram. It is not only profound but also lofty, applying its utmost virtue to fully implement the path of restraint. The commentary explains this line: \"The auspiciousness of steadfast restraint\" signifies attaining the end through thickness. It highlights that by maintaining steadfast and genuine virtues, one can suppress wrongful desires, resulting in auspiciousness, demonstrating that six at the top can uphold virtuous conduct to the end. This line advises people that to restrain one\\'s words and actions, one must possess steadfast virtue. Only through steadfast and honest character can one achieve auspiciousness; otherwise, it leads to opportunistic behavior of small-minded individuals, harming both oneself and others.'}}\n",

The First Nine represents the lower layers of society, who typically do not travel by carriage. As life becomes more affluent, in order to facilitate walking, people begin to adorn their feet. How is it adorned?

When encountering this hexagram through divination, it is unfavorable for marrying a woman.\\n\\nThe Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven; the lower trigram is Xun, which represents Wind. Thus, it signifies wind under Heaven, which is the image of the Gou hexagram. Observing this image, the ruler is inspired to emulate the wind's way of touching all things gently, spreading teachings and enlightenment across the world, and proclaiming it to the four corners.\", 'book_DuanYi': 'The Gòu Hexagram has Qián above and Xùn below, consisting of one yin and five yang, belonging to the initial hexagram of the Qián Palace. The Gòu Hexagram signifies yin encountering yang, with the soft prevailing over the hard, suggesting an unexpected encounter. However, it is not suitable for marrying a woman. When encountering this hexagram, it is favorable to plan affairs, and if encountering fire, there will also be joyous events.', 'scholar_interpretation': \"Yin waxes while yang wanes, and great fortune declines; many obstacles present themselves, and one must proceed with caution. Those who receive this hexagram find that yin prospers while yang weakens, leading to numerous unfavorable circumstances. It is advised to act cautiously and to be especially mindful of romantic entanglements.\\n\\nAccording to the Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:\\nFortune: It is the time of good luck, with fame spreading across the world.\\nWealth: Travelers afar can profit.\\nHousehold: Be cautious of strong winds; marriage is proper.\\nHealth: Beware of strokes.\", 'traditional': 'This hexagram is formed by stacking two different trigrams (below Xun, above Qian). Qian represents heaven, and Xun represents wind. There is wind under heaven, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, making all things flourish. The Gòu hexagram is the opposite of the Guài hexagram, constituting what is called a \"complementary hexagram.\" Gòu signifies encounter, where Yin meets Yang. However, with five Yangs and one Yin, they cannot coexist for long.\\n\\nThe Great Image: Wind penetrates everywhere, and everything it blows upon is exposed, meaning chance encounters.\\n\\nFortunes: The Yin rises and the Yang declines; be wary of romantic entanglements. Obstacles are prevalent, requiring cautious action.\\n\\nCareer: Proceed according to timing and sequence. However, potential crises lurk, with a lack of harmony between Yin and Yang. It is essential to rely on the strength of others, maintain various connections, enhance one\\'s influence, prevent petty people from taking advantage, and strive for a change in situation. It is advisable to prepare early for all matters, wait for the opportunity, and act immediately once it is ready.\\n\\nBusiness: The market is shifting from prosperity to danger; it is wise to withdraw early. Forceful expansion is risky. No upright individuals are helping, while schemers lurk in the shadows. Thus, it is critical to maintain a clear mind, seek reliable partners, and endure while waiting for the right moment for commercial activities to redevelop.\\n\\nFame: A character that does not easily integrate with others and an overly high opinion of oneself can naturally result in distress and unmet aspirations. One should rely on sincere and upright individuals and achieve success under their support.\\n\\nMarriage: Thoroughly examine the moral qualities of your partner and avoid becoming ensnared in a \"triangle\" dispute. Spouses should treat each other with sincerity to turn crises into safety.\\n\\nDecision-making: Favorable. One can develop smoothly in advantageous environments, but must avoid reckless actions to prevent counterproductive results. Furthermore, consistently guard against the entrapment of petty people nearby. Therefore, one should curb evil before it gains momentum, and it is better to remain isolated than to associate with unscrupulous people.', 'philosophy': 'The Hexagram Gou, also known as the Significance of the Hexagram of Heavenly Wind Gou\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram is a hexagram of different trigrams stacked together, with the lower trigram being Xun and the upper trigram being Qian. Qian represents Heaven, and Xun represents Wind. There is wind under the heavens, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, and all things flourish.\\n\\nGou means encounter. In the Gou hexagram, Qian is Heaven above, Xun is Wind below, symbolizing a person\\'s aspirations and ideals. Just like the wind moves everywhere under the heavens, opportunities for realization will be encountered.\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram follows the Guai hexagram. In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it is analyzed as follows: \"After decision, there must be encounter; hence, Gou follows. Gou means encounter.\" After deciding and departing, one is bound to have encounters, which is why the Gou Hexagram follows. The Gou hexagram is opposite to the Guai hexagram, and they complement each other as \"opposite hexagrams.\"\\n\\nIn the Commentary on the Images, Gou is explained in this way: \"There is wind under heaven, Gou; the ruler gives commands to the four directions.\" This points out that the hexagram Gou has the image of Wind (Xun) below Heaven (Qian) above. It is an image of the wind blowing across the realm, intertwined with all things, symbolizing \"encounter.\" Just as the wind blows across the earth, so should the ruler issue orders that spread in all directions.\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram represents the encounter between male and female. This hexagram signifies news and represents the month of May. Gou belongs to the upper hexagram. The Commentary on the Images provides this judgment: \"Meeting friends in a foreign land with joy and cheer, knowing that Fortune\\'s favor grows bolder here. From now on, embark on a smooth course ahead, ensuring nothing will interfere as you tread.\"'}, 'line_1': {'description': 'At the beginning six: Tied to a metal brake, perseverance brings good fortune.

This is an auspicious omen for constancy. However, if one inquires about going somewhere, danger is inevitable, like a frail pig unwillingly dragged back. The commentary says: The fine, soft thread attached to the yellow brass brake signifies that something soft is restrained by something hard, symbolizing the weak depending on the strong, thus achieving auspiciousness.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Plain Line: Those who receive this line may either encounter noble people and friends who help them prosper, or women may have the joy of giving birth. On the negative side, one must guard against illness, litigation, and worries, or women may face issues of infidelity.

The first six is meant to take action but is held back like a pig, resulting in struggle and restlessness.\\n\\nIn the hexagram image, the first six is a yin line in a yang position, losing authority and not centered. The yin energy is prevailing, lacking central correctness. There is an urge to act, but advancing will threaten the yang line, thus \"misfortune is seen.\" Restraint and adherence to the middle path bring fortune.\\n\\nThe Commentary explains: \"Tied to a metal brake,\" suggesting gentle action with restraint. Specifically, it states: \"Tightly bound to the copper vehicle brake,\" thereby regulating its conduct.\\n\\nThose obtaining this line should not be controlled by irrational and uncontrollable emotions, as this leads to losing control and falling into a dilemma. It is crucial to wait patiently, avoiding impatience and impulsivity.\\n\\nIf a woman obtains this line, she should focus on household matters, care for the elderly, her husband, and children, maintaining the household to stay fortunate.\\n\\nFirst six reads: Tied to a metal brake, upright and auspicious. If pursuit occurs, misfortune will be seen; a restrained pig still struggles to move.\\n\\nThe symbolism suggests: Tied to a metal weaving instrument, it means the yielding is restrained by the steadfast.'}, 'line_2': {'description': 'Nine in the second place: In wrapping, there is a fish, no blame; it is not favorable for a guest.\\n\\nThe Image says: In wrapping, there is a fish; the meaning does not extend to the guest.', 'interpretation': 'There are fish in the kitchen. Obtaining this line through divination, there are no calamities, but it is not favorable to host banquets for guests. The Commentary on the Symbol says: There are fish in the kitchen. Having fish but no meat symbolizes modest prosperity, and it is not appropriate to lavishly entertain guests.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Flat: For those who receive this line, there is good fortune in terms of wealth, and for women, there is the joy of pregnancy. Those in official positions have the prospect of promotion.\\n\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\\n\\nFortune: Keep away from petty people to naturally gain benefit.  \\nWealth: Goods are plentiful, and profits are in your hands.  \\nHome: The woman takes charge; marriage can be accomplished.  \\nHealth: Like a fish being harmed in a pond.', 'philosophy': 'Nine in the second position: Containing fish, no misfortune; not suitable for guests.\\n\\nExplanation of the line statement: The meaning of this line is: Finding fish in the kitchen will not lead to disaster; however, it is not suitable for entertaining guests.\\n\\nFrom the image of the hexagram, nine in the second position is a yang line in a yin position, situated in the middle of the lower gua (trigram). This represents a noble person who is strong yet gentle. The first six and nine in the second position are closely associated, both residing in the lower gua, symbolizing childhood sweethearts as husband and wife. However, the first six corresponds with the fourth nine. To keep the first six tied, the nine in the second position must impose strict control and foster deeper emotional connections.\\n\\nFor those who obtain this line, do not let emotions and women dominate you; maintain the ability to control your loved ones, and do not open your heart to everyone. Currently, the woman you love remains steadfast in her affection for you even in difficult circumstances. Although there are suitors, she remains unmoved.\\n\\nNine in the second position: Containing fish, no misfortune, not suitable for guests.\\n\\nThe Image says: Containing fish, the intention is not to share it with guests.\\n\\nThe meaning of the text is: Having fish within, there is no calamity, but it is not appropriate for entertaining guests.\\n\\nThe meaning of the Image commentary is: Having fish within, it comes from the reasoning not to offer it to guests.'}, 'line_3': {'description': 'Nine in the third place: The buttocks are without flesh, causing one\\'s steps to be unsteady.

The meaning of this line is: the skin on the buttocks is rubbed off, making movement very difficult; danger will be encountered, but no major calamity will occur.\\n\\nThe first half of the text for the nine at the third position is similar to the first half of the text for the nine at the fourth position of the Guài Hexagram. The nine at the third position is occupied by a yang line, indicating momentum, but with no positive response above, making it uneasy and immobilized. It\\'s akin to a middle-aged man who has yet to marry, desperately in need of love\\'s solace. However, in this hexagram, only the first six is a yin line, representing a woman. The nine at the third position wants to pursue the first six, but it is obstructed by the nine at the second position. Fortunately, the nine at the third position, being a yang line in a firm position, able to maintain integrity, only harbors affection and has not taken action.\\n\\nFor those who receive this line, the current situation is difficult, and a crisis is being faced. However, if you remain calm, you can avoid entangling yourself in meaningless interpersonal disputes. As long as you are not controlled by the environment and emotions, you can peacefully overcome the difficulties.\\n\\n\"Nines at the third: the buttocks have no skin, advancing is difficult; there is danger, but no great misfortune.\"\\n\\nThe symbolism states: \"Advancing is difficult, as no one is there to support.\"\\n\\nThe meaning in the text is: the buttocks are seriously injured, walking is difficult. There is danger, but no major disaster. The interpretation of the symbolism indicates that walking is difficult due to the absence of assistance.\\n\\nThe nine at the third position naturally desires to seize this first six for a wife, so there is a struggle with the nine at the second position, leading to injury, removing the skin off his buttocks, and making walking extremely difficult. This is the danger caused by attempting marriage by force. However, since the nine at the third position does not lose his life over this, there will not be a great disaster.'}, 'line_4': {'description': 'Nine in the fourth place: There is a basket but no fish. This leads to misfortune.  \\nThe Image says: The misfortune of having no fish indicates distancing from the people.', 'interpretation': 'Nine in the fourth position: There is no fish in the kitchen. If one encounters this line through divination, any action taken will inevitably lead to misfortune.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: The line \"no fish in the kitchen\" indicates that the person will inevitably encounter misfortune. This is because the yang line at the fourth position occupies a yin place, resembling a ruler losing his authority and becoming estranged from the people.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Misfortune: Those who receive this line are often troubled by many disputes, and for the elderly, it is detrimental to their longevity. Officials may suffer losses and face many difficulties. Interpretation by Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong. Fortune: The correct fortune has not been obtained, broaden your mind.

Health: Deficiency fire is hard to treat, extremely dangerous.', 'philosophy': 'Hexagram Gou, Fourth Line, Line Statement:\\n\\nNine in the Fourth: There is no fish in the wrapping, leading to misfortune.\\n\\nInterpretation of the Line Statement:\\n\\nThe meaning of this line statement is: There is no fish in the kitchen, which will lead to danger.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fourth is in the middle of the entire hexagram and can be called \\'enwrapping\\' the lower line, the Initial Six. However, the Initial Six has already been encountered by the Nine in the Second and is enveloped by it, resulting in the Nine in the Fourth being \\'without fish in the wrap.\\' The Nine in the Fourth is a yang line in a yin position and is situated within the upper hexagram Qian, exhibiting characteristics of restlessness and eagerness. If action is taken, it will lead to calamity.\\n\\nIn the \"Image,\" this line is analyzed as: The misfortune of having no fish is due to being distant from the people. It is pointed out here that the absence of fish in the kitchen leading to danger is like a ruler losing the support of the people; being detached from the populace naturally leads to danger.\\n\\nThose who obtain this line may face setbacks in their emotions; perhaps the person you love will betray you. You should view this as the arrangement of fate, not blame her, nor be excessively sorrowful. In your endeavors, pay attention to controlling your emotions and engage in sincere communication with those around you, considering others\\' needs, so as to not lose their support, which will help in avoiding disasters.\\n\\nNine in the Fourth: There is no fish in the wrapping, leading to misfortune.\\n\\nSymbolism states: The misfortune of having no fish is due to being distant from the subjects.\\n\\nThe text means: There is no fish in the wrap, resulting in danger.\\n\\nThe symbolism explicates: The danger of having no fish in the wrap is caused by being distant from the subjects.'}, 'line_5': {'description': \"Nine in the Fifth Place: Using the branches of the sophora tree to encase the melon, concealing one's brilliance, there are things that fall from the heavens.\\n\\nThe Image says: The Ninth in the Fifth Place conceals brilliance, indicating central correctness; when things fall from the heavens, it shows the determination not to abandon one's destiny.\\n\\nIt discusses the concealed elegance, referring to how the Fifth Line of Nine occupies the central position in the upper trigram, like a person endowed with the virtue of central correctness. The fall from heaven indicates that noble aspirations cannot be realized, thus sacrificing one's life to remain true to one's principles.\", 'interpretation': 'Nine in the Fifth Position: A gourd grows intertwined with a mulberry tree, with its hidden patterns appearing very beautiful. Suddenly, a gourd falls from above the head.  \\nThe Image Commentary says:  ', 'scholar_interpretation': 'For one who receives this line, they will encounter influential patrons and have unexpected joys; a woman will have the joy of pregnancy. An official will become a pillar of talent. \\n\\nCommentary by Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong: \\n\\nFate: With an open mind, fame and success will naturally appear. \\n\\nWealth: Wood-related products will bring great profit. \\n\\nHome: A residence of uprightness; marriage will be auspicious. \\n\\nHealth: Heat mixed with cold; quickly seek a good doctor.', 'philosophy': 'Hexagram Encounter, Ninth Five Line: Line Statement: Nine in the Fifth Place: Wrapping a melon with branches and leaves of the wolfberry tree, embodying virtue, blessings descend from heaven. Explanation of the Line Statement: Wolfberry refers to the leaves of the wolfberry tree. Descent means to fall or land. The meaning of this line statement is: Using branches and leaves of the wolfberry tree to wrap a melon symbolizes possessing admirable virtue internally, blessings descend from heaven. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth Place is a yang line occupying the position of the ruler, maintaining balance, capable of encompassing the entire hexagram, stabilizing the overall situation. The \"Image\" explains this line: Nine in the Fifth Place embodies virtue, maintaining balance; blessings descend from heaven, signifying unwavering adherence to one\\'s destiny. This indicates that although occupying the highest position, one can uphold the middle path and maintain a pure heart. As a result, the situations one encounters are optimal, needing no rushing around to meet with the blessings bestowed by heaven. This fully illustrates that as long as one does not violate the mandate of heaven, good fortune will be encountered.'}, 'line_6': {'description': 'Top Nine: Encountering its horn, regret, no blame.  \\nThe Image says: Encountering its horn signifies exhaustion at the top, leading to regret.', 'interpretation': \"Top Nine: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn's edge, is not a good omen, but there is no great calamity.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn's edge, is because the top nine yang line is positioned at the end of the hexagram, resembling a person in a situation of adversity.\", 'scholar_interpretation': 'Misfortune: Those who obtain this line face difficulties in planning and are isolated and helpless. Officials may achieve great recognition, but their good fortune is nearing its end. Scholars who strive diligently can achieve excellent results.\\n\\nInterpretation by the Taiwanese Confucian Master Fu Peirong:\\n\\nFortune: Great recognition and fame, but fortune is nearly exhausted.\\n\\nWealth: Careful calculations lead to substantial profit.\\n\\nHome: Beware of the corners of the house; concerns about disparities in age among couples.\\n\\nHealth: Ailment in the head, but can be treated with medical attention.', 'philosophy': \"The sixth line of the Gou Hexagram says: Top nine: Encountering its horns; there is distress, but no misfortune.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: growing horns on the head signifies a difficult situation, but there won’t be major disasters.\\n\\nTop nine: Encountering its horns, there is distress, but no misfortune.\\n\\nThe image says: Encountering its horns, there is distress because it is the extreme top.\\n\\nThe text means encountering a hard-headed confrontation, which brings trouble, but no disaster. The image explanation is: encountering such confrontation occurs because the top nine is in an extreme position, hence the trouble arises.\\n\\nThis top nine is akin to the oldest bachelor in a village, who no longer has the opportunity to meet someone gentle and feminine. However, because he is regarded as an elder, he is instead confronted by the younger generation. His first adversary is nine-four, who, having failed to secure a wife, naturally complains to his elder: “Why are you so poor, couldn’t you help me get a wife?” Such words are something nine-four would certainly say. The top nine would also be confronted by nine-five, as nine-five is pressured by the growth of the yin line to retreat to the position of the top nine, in such a case, the top nine can only be filled with worries. But why is there no disaster? Because the top nine is poor and old, in ancient times, dying of old age was considered a joyful event, so the top nine just has to wait for death—how could there be disaster?\\n\\nIn summary, the misfortune of the sixth line of the Gou Hexagram arises from not heeding the hexagram’s guidance of “do not seek a woman.” However, getting married and having children is something that no one can stop, and the natural cycle of yin growing and yang declining is beyond human control. Therefore, the disaster brought by the “strength of the female” cannot be avoided.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line, it is important first to understand their real situation clearly. Do not be overly arrogant, and develop good relations with colleagues or subordinates, and make genuine friends. Some tasks cannot be completed alone and require the help of others to succeed. In the face of the immense, unpredictable forces of the world, an individual's power is small. One should only do what they are capable of, so do not think too highly of oneself, or you may find yourself in a dead-end like a bull stuck in a narrow corner, causing your career to reach an impasse.\"}}.\n",

The sentence indicates that the opposing side presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a tribute. Do not decline. The meaning of this line is: Someone presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it will bring great fortune.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line occupying a strong position, with a harmony of firmness and softness. Besides being in a correct response with the second line (a yang line), it also connects with the top ninth line. The analysis in \"Image\" explains this line: The great auspiciousness of the fifth line is blessed by higher realms. It points out that the great fortune of the fifth line is entirely due to heavenly blessing. The fifth line, though gentle and residing in a dignified position, still seeks to reduce itself to benefit others. This not only earns broad support from the public but also gains the favor of the heavens. Drawing this line is extremely auspicious, akin to finding jade amidst stone, resulting in financial gain. Perhaps those you have helped previously will begin to repay you. The wealth brought to you is deserved, so do not refuse it. If ever confused, if someone suggests releasing a valuable tortoise, you might do so for great prosperity.\\n\\nThe fifth line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it is greatly auspicious. The symbolic explanation notes that the great fortune of the fifth line comes from the protection of the top ninth line. The fifth has obtained a tortoise worth ten \"peng,\" which symbolizes power. The fifth line is in a dignified position, bestowed by whom? By the top ninth line, who comes from the third line of Tai Hexagram to the top ninth line of Sun Hexagram to assist the fifth line in consolidating power.

If you meet a friend in need of help, while assisting them, you should also point out their weaknesses, and they will surely appreciate it.\\n\\nThe fourth line: Reduce one\\'s ailments, swiftly bring joy, no blame.\\n\\nXiang commentary says: Reducing one\\'s ailments is also delightful.\\n\\nThe meaning of the text is: Alleviate the pain of illness, quickly improve the condition, with no disaster. The meaning of Xiang commentary is: Alleviating pain from illness is also a delightful matter.\\n\\nWhat is meant by \"reduce one\\'s ailments\" here? It refers to the \"in-fighting\" ailment. In the Tai hexagram, the upper hexagram consists of three yin lines, and such a configuration is analogous to the situation we discussed, similar to ten Chinese sharing a space. This scenario easily leads to in-fighting, resulting in a loss of collective strength. What can be done? The only solution is to reduce one yin line to the lower hexagram, and similarly to transfer one yang line from the lower hexagram to the upper. This creates the Sun hexagram. With this change, the phenomenon of in-fighting is avoided, thus strengthening the collective force. This is the meaning of loss being the beginning of greater strength.'}, {'description': 'When three people travel together, one will be lost; when one person travels alone, they will find a companion.  \\nThe Image says: When one travels alone, with three there is doubt.', 'interpretation': 'Line three: When three people walk together, differing opinions are inevitable, and one person will surely end up isolated. When one person walks alone, feeling lonely and helpless, they will proactively invite others to join them. \\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: When one person walks alone, they make decisions on their own, and nothing hinders their actions. When three people walk together, they each adhere to their own views, leading to the growth of doubt.', 'scholar_interpretation': \"Level: Those who receive this line should cooperate in their endeavors and will find many benefits; unmarried individuals will find partners.

When one acts alone, he can meet like-minded friends. The Image Commentary analyzes this line as follows: When one walks alone, with three there is doubt. It points out that when three people proceed together, one of them may suffer harm; acting alone can lead to finding companions with shared interests. This indicates that collective efforts should not be rushed without considering the situation; effectiveness and practicality must be prioritized.\\n\\nFor those divining this line, it suggests not engaging too many partners when undertaking tasks; otherwise, conflicts and differences may arise, causing discord. If acting alone, one can proceed while seeking like-minded companions, thus gaining their support.\\n\\nFor individuals drawing this line, it is advised to concentrate on their tasks without having too many thoughts or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. Managing too much can lead to failure, incurring losses. Focus and having one\\'s own opinion are crucial, rather than blindly following others.\\n\\nThe Image Meaning explains that walking alone finds friends, since with three people, doubts arise. \"Three people walking\" refers to the lower three yang lines of the Tai Hexagram, and \"losing one\" means the ninth line of Tai leaves its position to join the ninth line of Diminishing. \"One person walking\" refers to the second yang line of Tai moving to the upper line position in Diminishing. \"Finding his companion\" indicates the upper ninth line of Diminishing corresponds with the fifth six line and resonates with the third six line.\\n\\nFundamentally, this line reflects a human weakness. For example, it\\'s said in the West that one Chinese person can defeat one Japanese person, but ten Chinese might not defeat ten Japanese. Why is this? Because situations occur like \"two people walking, one loses out.\" Among ten Chinese, internal conflict often arises, making it difficult to collectively rival the other group. This illustrates that human weaknesses can diminish the power of collective effort.'}, {'description': 'At the beginning of Nine: After the matter is completed, proceed promptly, there is no blame, ponder the decrease of it.\\n\\nThe Image says: After the matter is completed, proceeding promptly aligns harmoniously with the aspiration.', 'interpretation': 'Initial Nine: In significant sacrificial rituals, one must promptly participate.

However, appropriately consider reducing some of your own benefits.\\n\\n\"Already\": to stop. \"Swiftly\": quickly and promptly. \"Consider\": appropriately.\\n\\nThe meaning of the line text is: Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others; there will be no disaster. It\\'s appropriate to moderately reduce some benefits for yourself.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the First Nine is at the beginning of the Hexagram of Decrease, indicating the need to decrease below while benefiting above. This must be done appropriately, without excess or overindulgence.\\n\\nIn the \"Image\" it is explained: \"Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed,\" which means aligning with the intention. It is pointed out here: \"Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others.\" Those in honored positions, who are weak, need assistance. Therefore, those in humble positions, full of vigor, should take the lead, not shirk responsibility, and immediately sacrifice their own pursuits to help others achieve greatness. This demonstrates a relationship of mutual harmony with those in high places.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line in divination, if someone around you encounters difficulties, you should promptly offer assistance. Although there may be some loss, it can build connections and leave a good impression on others. However, do not provide all your help; only offer appropriate assistance.\\n\\nFirst Nine: Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed; there will be no misfortune. Consider reducing.\\n\\nThe Image says: Once tasks are completed, swiftly proceed; it aligns with one\\'s aspirations.\\n\\nThe text means: Having completed tasks, one goes quickly, without disaster, only losing a little, like not drinking much. The Image means: Upon completing tasks, going quickly aligns with one’s intentions.\\n\\nThe First Nine and Six Four correspond, like Six Four hosting a banquet and inviting the First Nine. The First Nine, due to being preoccupied, finishes the work at hand and then goes to the banquet, only to arrive somewhat late after others have eaten and drunk, leaving just remains. This type of loss is merely missing out on some drinks, thus not leading to disaster. The intent of the First Nine attending the banquet was not for eating or drinking, but to engage with Six Four.'}].\n",

      "### Hexagram Insights: Coming to Meet (Hexagram 44)\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **General Aspects**:\n",
      "   - The overarching theme of \"Coming to Meet\" is about encounters or interactions that might bring challenges. It suggests exercising caution, particularly in relationships, which can influence career progress indirectly. The idea is to ensure that beneficial, rather than burdensome, associations are cultivated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Line Specifics and Changes**:\n",
      "   - **Line 1**: You should engage cautiously at first. This initial restraint indicates that rushing forward could counteract your progress. Timing should be thoughtfully chosen.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Resulting Hexagram: Diminishing (Hexagram 41)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Diminishing emphasizes the importance of refining your focus and trimming excess efforts to channel energies effectively. This could mean identifying and honing in on critical skills or responsibilities that could pave the way for advancement. Align your actions with your goals to ensure your efforts are directed toward your promotion aims.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thus, while there may be initial challenges or the need to maintain disciplined focus, this reading hints at the real possibility of promotion through strategic preparation and openness to unexpected opportunities.

The sovereign, thereby, uses it to issue commands and proclamations to the four quarters.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \"Hexagram Gou: A dream of a woman being injured. When encountering this hexagram through divination, it is unfavorable for marrying a woman.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven; the lower trigram is Xun, which represents Wind. Thus, it signifies wind under Heaven, which is the image of the Gou hexagram. Observing this image, the ruler is inspired to emulate the wind\\'s way of touching all things gently, spreading teachings and enlightenment across the world, and proclaiming it to the four corners.\", \\'book_DuanYi\\': \\'The Gòu Hexagram has Qián above and Xùn below, consisting of one yin and five yang, belonging to the initial hexagram of the Qián Palace. The Gòu Hexagram signifies yin encountering yang, with the soft prevailing over the hard, suggesting an unexpected encounter. However, it is not suitable for marrying a woman. When encountering this hexagram, it is favorable to plan affairs, and if encountering fire, there will also be joyous events.\\', \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \"Yin waxes while yang wanes, and great fortune declines; many obstacles present themselves, and one must proceed with caution. Those who receive this hexagram find that yin prospers while yang weakens, leading to numerous unfavorable circumstances. It is advised to act cautiously and to be especially mindful of romantic entanglements.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong\\'s interpretation:\\\\nFortune: It is the time of good luck, with fame spreading across the world.\\\\nWealth: Travelers afar can profit.\\\\nHousehold: Be cautious of strong winds; marriage is proper.\\\\nHealth: Beware of strokes.\", \\'traditional\\': \\'This hexagram is formed by stacking two different trigrams (below Xun, above Qian). Qian represents heaven, and Xun represents wind. There is wind under heaven, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, making all things flourish. The Gòu hexagram is the opposite of the Guài hexagram, constituting what is called a \"complementary hexagram.\" Gòu signifies encounter, where Yin meets Yang. However, with five Yangs and one Yin, they cannot coexist for long.\\\\n\\\\nThe Great Image: Wind penetrates everywhere, and everything it blows upon is exposed, meaning chance encounters.\\\\n\\\\nFortunes: The Yin rises and the Yang declines; be wary of romantic entanglements. Obstacles are prevalent, requiring cautious action.\\\\n\\\\nCareer: Proceed according to timing and sequence. However, potential crises lurk, with a lack of harmony between Yin and Yang. It is essential to rely on the strength of others, maintain various connections, enhance one\\\\\\'s influence, prevent petty people from taking advantage, and strive for a change in situation. It is advisable to prepare early for all matters, wait for the opportunity, and act immediately once it is ready.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness: The market is shifting from prosperity to danger; it is wise to withdraw early. Forceful expansion is risky. No upright individuals are helping, while schemers lurk in the shadows. Thus, it is critical to maintain a clear mind, seek reliable partners, and endure while waiting for the right moment for commercial activities to redevelop.\\\\n\\\\nFame: A character that does not easily integrate with others and an overly high opinion of oneself can naturally result in distress and unmet aspirations. One should rely on sincere and upright individuals and achieve success under their support.\\\\n\\\\nMarriage: Thoroughly examine the moral qualities of your partner and avoid becoming ensnared in a \"triangle\" dispute. Spouses should treat each other with sincerity to turn crises into safety.\\\\n\\\\nDecision-making: Favorable. One can develop smoothly in advantageous environments, but must avoid reckless actions to prevent counterproductive results. Furthermore, consistently guard against the entrapment of petty people nearby. Therefore, one should curb evil before it gains momentum, and it is better to remain isolated than to associate with unscrupulous people.\\', \\'philosophy\\': \\'The Hexagram Gou, also known as the Significance of the Hexagram of Heavenly Wind Gou\\\\n\\\\nThe Gou hexagram is a hexagram of different trigrams stacked together, with the lower trigram being Xun and the upper trigram being Qian. Qian represents Heaven, and Xun represents Wind. There is wind under the heavens, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, and all things flourish.\\\\n\\\\nGou means encounter. In the Gou hexagram, Qian is Heaven above, Xun is Wind below, symbolizing a person\\\\\\'s aspirations and ideals. Just like the wind moves everywhere under the heavens, opportunities for realization will be encountered.\\\\n\\\\nThe Gou hexagram follows the Guai hexagram. In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it is analyzed as follows: \"After decision, there must be encounter; hence, Gou follows. Gou means encounter.\" After deciding and departing, one is bound to have encounters, which is why the Gou Hexagram follows. The Gou hexagram is opposite to the Guai hexagram, and they complement each other as \"opposite hexagrams.\"\\\\n\\\\nIn the Commentary on the Images, Gou is explained in this way: \"There is wind under heaven, Gou; the ruler gives commands to the four directions.\" This points out that the hexagram Gou has the image of Wind (Xun) below Heaven (Qian) above. It is an image of the wind blowing across the realm, intertwined with all things, symbolizing \"encounter.\" Just as the wind blows across the earth, so should the ruler issue orders that spread in all directions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Gou hexagram represents the encounter between male and female. This hexagram signifies news and represents the month of May. Gou belongs to the upper hexagram. The Commentary on the Images provides this judgment: \"Meeting friends in a foreign land with joy and cheer, knowing that Fortune\\\\\\'s favor grows bolder here. From now on, embark on a smooth course ahead, ensuring nothing will interfere as you tread.\"\\'}, \\'line_1\\': {\\'description\\': \\'At the beginning six: Tied to a metal brake, perseverance brings good fortune.

This is an auspicious omen for constancy. However, if one inquires about going somewhere, danger is inevitable, like a frail pig unwillingly dragged back. The commentary says: The fine, soft thread attached to the yellow brass brake signifies that something soft is restrained by something hard, symbolizing the weak depending on the strong, thus achieving auspiciousness.\\', \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \\'Plain Line: Those who receive this line may either encounter noble people and friends who help them prosper, or women may have the joy of giving birth. On the negative side, one must guard against illness, litigation, and worries, or women may face issues of infidelity. Officials may have the concern of being demoted.\\\\n\\\\nExplanation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan:\\\\nFortune: It is advisable to maintain the status quo and not to act rashly.\\\\nFinancial Fortune: Suitable for opening a store; not favorable for traveling as a merchant.\\\\nHousehold: Uphold family reputation; men outside, women inside.\\\\nHealth: Weakness requires quiet recuperation.\\', \\'philosophy\\': \\'Hexagram Gou\\\\\\'s first line reads: Tied to a metal brake, upright and auspicious; if there is a pursuit, misfortune will be seen, much like a restrained pig struggling hesitantly.\\\\n\\\\nSheep in the I Ching symbolize the yang line, while pigs represent the yin line. The first six is meant to take action but is held back like a pig, resulting in struggle and restlessness.\\\\n\\\\nIn the hexagram image, the first six is a yin line in a yang position, losing authority and not centered. The yin energy is prevailing, lacking central correctness. There is an urge to act, but advancing will threaten the yang line, thus \"misfortune is seen.\" Restraint and adherence to the middle path bring fortune.\\\\n\\\\nThe Commentary explains: \"Tied to a metal brake,\" suggesting gentle action with restraint. Specifically, it states: \"Tightly bound to the copper vehicle brake,\" thereby regulating its conduct.\\\\n\\\\nThose obtaining this line should not be controlled by irrational and uncontrollable emotions, as this leads to losing control and falling into a dilemma. It is crucial to wait patiently, avoiding impatience and impulsivity.\\\\n\\\\nIf a woman obtains this line, she should focus on household matters, care for the elderly, her husband, and children, maintaining the household to stay fortunate.\\\\n\\\\nFirst six reads: Tied to a metal brake, upright and auspicious. If pursuit occurs, misfortune will be seen; a restrained pig still struggles to move.\\\\n\\\\nThe symbolism suggests: Tied to a metal weaving instrument, it means the yielding is restrained by the steadfast.\\'}, \\'line_2\\': {\\'description\\': \\'Nine in the second place: In wrapping, there is a fish, no blame; it is not favorable for a guest.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: In wrapping, there is a fish; the meaning does not extend to the guest.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'There are fish in the kitchen. Obtaining this line through divination, there are no calamities, but it is not favorable to host banquets for guests. The Commentary on the Symbol says: There are fish in the kitchen. Having fish but no meat symbolizes modest prosperity, and it is not appropriate to lavishly entertain guests.\\', \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \\'Flat: For those who receive this line, there is good fortune in terms of wealth, and for women, there is the joy of pregnancy. Those in official positions have the prospect of promotion.\\\\n\\\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\\\\n\\\\nFortune: Keep away from petty people to naturally gain benefit.  \\\\nWealth: Goods are plentiful, and profits are in your hands.  \\\\nHome: The woman takes charge; marriage can be accomplished.  \\\\nHealth: Like a fish being harmed in a pond.\\', \\'philosophy\\': \\'Nine in the second position: Containing fish, no misfortune; not suitable for guests.\\\\n\\\\nExplanation of the line statement: The meaning of this line is: Finding fish in the kitchen will not lead to disaster; however, it is not suitable for entertaining guests.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the image of the hexagram, nine in the second position is a yang line in a yin position, situated in the middle of the lower gua (trigram). This represents a noble person who is strong yet gentle. The first six and nine in the second position are closely associated, both residing in the lower gua, symbolizing childhood sweethearts as husband and wife. However, the first six corresponds with the fourth nine. To keep the first six tied, the nine in the second position must impose strict control and foster deeper emotional connections.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who obtain this line, do not let emotions and women dominate you; maintain the ability to control your loved ones, and do not open your heart to everyone. Currently, the woman you love remains steadfast in her affection for you even in difficult circumstances. Although there are suitors, she remains unmoved.\\\\n\\\\nNine in the second position: Containing fish, no misfortune, not suitable for guests.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: Containing fish, the intention is not to share it with guests.\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of the text is: Having fish within, there is no calamity, but it is not appropriate for entertaining guests.\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of the Image commentary is: Having fish within, it comes from the reasoning not to offer it to guests.\\'}, \\'line_3\\': {\\'description\\': \\'Nine in the third place: The buttocks are without flesh, causing one\\\\\\'s steps to be unsteady. There is danger, but no great misfortune.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: \"One\\\\\\'s steps are unsteady,\" indicating that his actions have not yet been guided.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'Nine in the third place: The hip is wounded, making walking difficult. Drawing this line indicates danger, but there is not yet a great disaster.  \\\\nThe Xiangci says: Walking with difficulty, because there is no support.\\', \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \\'Misfortune: For those who obtain this line, there are many disasters. Officials may experience setbacks or demotion.\\\\n\\\\nInterpretation by Fu Peirong, a renowned scholar of Taiwanese national studies:\\\\nFortune: Anxiety arises from doubt; remain calm and patient.\\\\nWealth: Indecisiveness leads to no profit.\\\\nHousehold: Renovate the home; proceeding slowly can bring success.\\\\nHealth: Restless and uneasy; seek medical consultation and treatment.\\', \\'philosophy\\': \\'The Judgement for the third line of the Gòu Hexagram reads: \"Nines at the third position: The buttocks have no skin, advancing is difficult; there is danger, but not great misfortune.\"\\\\n\\\\nInterpretation of the Judgement: In this context, \"difficult\" signifies an unstable manner of walking. The meaning of this line is: the skin on the buttocks is rubbed off, making movement very difficult; danger will be encountered, but no major calamity will occur.\\\\n\\\\nThe first half of the text for the nine at the third position is similar to the first half of the text for the nine at the fourth position of the Guài Hexagram. The nine at the third position is occupied by a yang line, indicating momentum, but with no positive response above, making it uneasy and immobilized. It\\\\\\'s akin to a middle-aged man who has yet to marry, desperately in need of love\\\\\\'s solace. However, in this hexagram, only the first six is a yin line, representing a woman. The nine at the third position wants to pursue the first six, but it is obstructed by the nine at the second position. Fortunately, the nine at the third position, being a yang line in a firm position, able to maintain integrity, only harbors affection and has not taken action.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who receive this line, the current situation is difficult, and a crisis is being faced. However, if you remain calm, you can avoid entangling yourself in meaningless interpersonal disputes. As long as you are not controlled by the environment and emotions, you can peacefully overcome the difficulties.\\\\n\\\\n\"Nines at the third: the buttocks have no skin, advancing is difficult; there is danger, but no great misfortune.\"\\\\n\\\\nThe symbolism states: \"Advancing is difficult, as no one is there to support.\"\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning in the text is: the buttocks are seriously injured, walking is difficult. There is danger, but no major disaster. The interpretation of the symbolism indicates that walking is difficult due to the absence of assistance.\\\\n\\\\nThe nine at the third position naturally desires to seize this first six for a wife, so there is a struggle with the nine at the second position, leading to injury, removing the skin off his buttocks, and making walking extremely difficult. This is the danger caused by attempting marriage by force. However, since the nine at the third position does not lose his life over this, there will not be a great disaster.\\'}, \\'line_4\\': {\\'description\\': \\'Nine in the fourth place: There is a basket but no fish.

If one encounters this line through divination, any action taken will inevitably lead to misfortune.\\\\n\\\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: The line \"no fish in the kitchen\" indicates that the person will inevitably encounter misfortune.

However, the Initial Six has already been encountered by the Nine in the Second and is enveloped by it, resulting in the Nine in the Fourth being \\\\\\'without fish in the wrap.\\\\\\' The Nine in the Fourth is a yang line in a yin position and is situated within the upper hexagram Qian, exhibiting characteristics of restlessness and eagerness. If action is taken, it will lead to calamity.\\\\n\\\\nIn the \"Image,\" this line is analyzed as: The misfortune of having no fish is due to being distant from the people. It is pointed out here that the absence of fish in the kitchen leading to danger is like a ruler losing the support of the people; being detached from the populace naturally leads to danger.\\\\n\\\\nThose who obtain this line may face setbacks in their emotions; perhaps the person you love will betray you. You should view this as the arrangement of fate, not blame her, nor be excessively sorrowful. In your endeavors, pay attention to controlling your emotions and engage in sincere communication with those around you, considering others\\\\\\' needs, so as to not lose their support, which will help in avoiding disasters.\\\\n\\\\nNine in the Fourth: There is no fish in the wrapping, leading to misfortune.\\\\n\\\\nSymbolism states: The misfortune of having no fish is due to being distant from the subjects.\\\\n\\\\nThe text means: There is no fish in the wrap, resulting in danger.\\\\n\\\\nThe symbolism explicates: The danger of having no fish in the wrap is caused by being distant from the subjects.\\'}, \\'line_5\\': {\\'description\\': \"Nine in the Fifth Place: Using the branches of the sophora tree to encase the melon, concealing one\\'s brilliance, there are things that fall from the heavens.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: The Ninth in the Fifth Place conceals brilliance, indicating central correctness; when things fall from the heavens, it shows the determination not to abandon one\\'s destiny.\\\\n\\\\nIt discusses the concealed elegance, referring to how the Fifth Line of Nine occupies the central position in the upper trigram, like a person endowed with the virtue of central correctness. The fall from heaven indicates that noble aspirations cannot be realized, thus sacrificing one\\'s life to remain true to one\\'s principles.\", \\'interpretation\\': \\'Nine in the Fifth Position: A gourd grows intertwined with a mulberry tree, with its hidden patterns appearing very beautiful.

Explanation of the Line Statement: Wolfberry refers to the leaves of the wolfberry tree. Descent means to fall or land. The meaning of this line statement is: Using branches and leaves of the wolfberry tree to wrap a melon symbolizes possessing admirable virtue internally, blessings descend from heaven. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth Place is a yang line occupying the position of the ruler, maintaining balance, capable of encompassing the entire hexagram, stabilizing the overall situation. The \"Image\" explains this line: Nine in the Fifth Place embodies virtue, maintaining balance; blessings descend from heaven, signifying unwavering adherence to one\\\\\\'s destiny. This indicates that although occupying the highest position, one can uphold the middle path and maintain a pure heart. As a result, the situations one encounters are optimal, needing no rushing around to meet with the blessings bestowed by heaven. This fully illustrates that as long as one does not violate the mandate of heaven, good fortune will be encountered.\\'}, \\'line_6\\': {\\'description\\': \\'Top Nine: Encountering its horn, regret, no blame.  \\\\nThe Image says: Encountering its horn signifies exhaustion at the top, leading to regret.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \"Top Nine: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn\\'s edge, is not a good omen, but there is no great calamity.\\\\n\\\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn\\'s edge, is because the top nine yang line is positioned at the end of the hexagram, resembling a person in a situation of adversity.\", \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \\'Misfortune: Those who obtain this line face difficulties in planning and are isolated and helpless.

The image explanation is: encountering such confrontation occurs because the top nine is in an extreme position, hence the trouble arises.\\\\n\\\\nThis top nine is akin to the oldest bachelor in a village, who no longer has the opportunity to meet someone gentle and feminine. However, because he is regarded as an elder, he is instead confronted by the younger generation. His first adversary is nine-four, who, having failed to secure a wife, naturally complains to his elder: “Why are you so poor, couldn’t you help me get a wife?” Such words are something nine-four would certainly say. The top nine would also be confronted by nine-five, as nine-five is pressured by the growth of the yin line to retreat to the position of the top nine, in such a case, the top nine can only be filled with worries. But why is there no disaster? Because the top nine is poor and old, in ancient times, dying of old age was considered a joyful event, so the top nine just has to wait for death—how could there be disaster?\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the misfortune of the sixth line of the Gou Hexagram arises from not heeding the hexagram’s guidance of “do not seek a woman.” However, getting married and having children is something that no one can stop, and the natural cycle of yin growing and yang declining is beyond human control. Therefore, the disaster brought by the “strength of the female” cannot be avoided.\\\\n\\\\nFor those receiving this line, it is important first to understand their real situation clearly. Do not be overly arrogant, and develop good relations with colleagues or subordinates, and make genuine friends. Some tasks cannot be completed alone and require the help of others to succeed. In the face of the immense, unpredictable forces of the world, an individual\\'s power is small. One should only do what they are capable of, so do not think too highly of oneself, or you may find yourself in a dead-end like a bull stuck in a narrow corner, causing your career to reach an impasse.\"}}.\\n    The lines that are changing are [5, 4, 3, 1].\\n    The information about the changed lines is [{\\'description\\': \\'Six in the fifth place: Someone benefits from it, a tortoise worth ten sheaves, no one can oppose it.

Do not refuse, and it will be greatly auspicious. Explanation of the line statement: \"Peng\" was an ancient monetary unit, with two shells forming one \"peng.\" \"Tortoise\" refers to a divine tortoise. The sentence indicates that the opposing side presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a tribute. Do not decline. The meaning of this line is: Someone presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it will bring great fortune.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line occupying a strong position, with a harmony of firmness and softness. Besides being in a correct response with the second line (a yang line), it also connects with the top ninth line. The analysis in \"Image\" explains this line: The great auspiciousness of the fifth line is blessed by higher realms. It points out that the great fortune of the fifth line is entirely due to heavenly blessing. The fifth line, though gentle and residing in a dignified position, still seeks to reduce itself to benefit others. This not only earns broad support from the public but also gains the favor of the heavens. Drawing this line is extremely auspicious, akin to finding jade amidst stone, resulting in financial gain. Perhaps those you have helped previously will begin to repay you. The wealth brought to you is deserved, so do not refuse it. If ever confused, if someone suggests releasing a valuable tortoise, you might do so for great prosperity.\\\\n\\\\nThe fifth line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it is greatly auspicious. The symbolic explanation notes that the great fortune of the fifth line comes from the protection of the top ninth line. The fifth has obtained a tortoise worth ten \"peng,\" which symbolizes power. The fifth line is in a dignified position, bestowed by whom? By the top ninth line, who comes from the third line of Tai Hexagram to the top ninth line of Sun Hexagram to assist the fifth line in consolidating power. Thus, the fifth line should not refuse but must properly exercise its power to achieve great fortune.\\'}, {\\'description\\': \"Line Six of the Fourth Hexagram: By reducing one\\'s haste, allowing for rapid joy, there is no fault.  \\\\nThe Image says: To reduce one\\'s haste is also a cause for joy.\", \\'interpretation\\': \\'Line four: To eliminate illness, quickly seek the aid of shamans and make offerings to the spirits, and the sickness will improve, ensuring there will be no misfortune.  \\\\nThe Image says: \"Seeking the aid of shamans and making offerings to the spirits to eliminate illness\" is indeed a cause for rejoicing.\\', \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \\'Obtaining this line signifies many celebratory events.

No blame.\\\\n\\\\nSwiftly: Quickly, immediately.\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of this line text is: Try to overcome your own weaknesses, welcome the joy that is about to come, and there will be no calamity.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fourth line is among the mutual Zhen (second, third, and fourth lines), Zhen is associated with decisive action, which further implies indecisiveness. The line text emphasizes the necessity to immediately correct this fault, for only then will joyful events occur.\\\\n\\\\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary on this line explains: \"Reducing one\\\\\\'s ailments\" is also delightful. It points out that one should endeavor to overcome personal weaknesses and be prepared to accept assistance from others. This act of overcoming personal weaknesses is indeed a joyous thing.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it suggests overcoming one\\\\\\'s weaknesses. If you encounter troubles in your endeavors, you should minimize the drawbacks quickly to facilitate a turnaround, thereby gaining benefits. If you meet a friend in need of help, while assisting them, you should also point out their weaknesses, and they will surely appreciate it.\\\\n\\\\nThe fourth line: Reduce one\\\\\\'s ailments, swiftly bring joy, no blame.\\\\n\\\\nXiang commentary says: Reducing one\\\\\\'s ailments is also delightful.\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning of the text is: Alleviate the pain of illness, quickly improve the condition, with no disaster. The meaning of Xiang commentary is: Alleviating pain from illness is also a delightful matter.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is meant by \"reduce one\\\\\\'s ailments\" here? It refers to the \"in-fighting\" ailment. In the Tai hexagram, the upper hexagram consists of three yin lines, and such a configuration is analogous to the situation we discussed, similar to ten Chinese sharing a space. This scenario easily leads to in-fighting, resulting in a loss of collective strength. What can be done? The only solution is to reduce one yin line to the lower hexagram, and similarly to transfer one yang line from the lower hexagram to the upper. This creates the Sun hexagram. With this change, the phenomenon of in-fighting is avoided, thus strengthening the collective force. This is the meaning of loss being the beginning of greater strength.\\'}, {\\'description\\': \\'When three people travel together, one will be lost; when one person travels alone, they will find a companion.  \\\\nThe Image says: When one travels alone, with three there is doubt.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'Line three: When three people walk together, differing opinions are inevitable, and one person will surely end up isolated.

When one acts alone, he can meet like-minded friends. The Image Commentary analyzes this line as follows: When one walks alone, with three there is doubt. It points out that when three people proceed together, one of them may suffer harm; acting alone can lead to finding companions with shared interests. This indicates that collective efforts should not be rushed without considering the situation; effectiveness and practicality must be prioritized.\\\\n\\\\nFor those divining this line, it suggests not engaging too many partners when undertaking tasks; otherwise, conflicts and differences may arise, causing discord. If acting alone, one can proceed while seeking like-minded companions, thus gaining their support.\\\\n\\\\nFor individuals drawing this line, it is advised to concentrate on their tasks without having too many thoughts or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. Managing too much can lead to failure, incurring losses. Focus and having one\\\\\\'s own opinion are crucial, rather than blindly following others.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image Meaning explains that walking alone finds friends, since with three people, doubts arise. \"Three people walking\" refers to the lower three yang lines of the Tai Hexagram, and \"losing one\" means the ninth line of Tai leaves its position to join the ninth line of Diminishing. \"One person walking\" refers to the second yang line of Tai moving to the upper line position in Diminishing. \"Finding his companion\" indicates the upper ninth line of Diminishing corresponds with the fifth six line and resonates with the third six line.\\\\n\\\\nFundamentally, this line reflects a human weakness. For example, it\\\\\\'s said in the West that one Chinese person can defeat one Japanese person, but ten Chinese might not defeat ten Japanese. Why is this? Because situations occur like \"two people walking, one loses out.\" Among ten Chinese, internal conflict often arises, making it difficult to collectively rival the other group. This illustrates that human weaknesses can diminish the power of collective effort.\\'}, {\\'description\\': \\'At the beginning of Nine: After the matter is completed, proceed promptly, there is no blame, ponder the decrease of it.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: After the matter is completed, proceeding promptly aligns harmoniously with the aspiration.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'Initial Nine: In significant sacrificial rituals, one must promptly participate.

It\\\\\\'s appropriate to moderately reduce some benefits for yourself.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the hexagram image, the First Nine is at the beginning of the Hexagram of Decrease, indicating the need to decrease below while benefiting above. This must be done appropriately, without excess or overindulgence.\\\\n\\\\nIn the \"Image\" it is explained: \"Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed,\" which means aligning with the intention. It is pointed out here: \"Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others.\" Those in honored positions, who are weak, need assistance. Therefore, those in humble positions, full of vigor, should take the lead, not shirk responsibility, and immediately sacrifice their own pursuits to help others achieve greatness. This demonstrates a relationship of mutual harmony with those in high places.\\\\n\\\\nFor those receiving this line in divination, if someone around you encounters difficulties, you should promptly offer assistance. Although there may be some loss, it can build connections and leave a good impression on others. However, do not provide all your help; only offer appropriate assistance.\\\\n\\\\nFirst Nine: Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed; there will be no misfortune. Consider reducing.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: Once tasks are completed, swiftly proceed; it aligns with one\\\\\\'s aspirations.\\\\n\\\\nThe text means: Having completed tasks, one goes quickly, without disaster, only losing a little, like not drinking much. The Image means: Upon completing tasks, going quickly aligns with one’s intentions.\\\\n\\\\nThe First Nine and Six Four correspond, like Six Four hosting a banquet and inviting the First Nine. The First Nine, due to being preoccupied, finishes the work at hand and then goes to the banquet, only to arrive somewhat late after others have eaten and drunk, leaving just remains. This type of loss is merely missing out on some drinks, thus not leading to disaster. The intent of the First Nine attending the banquet was not for eating or drinking, but to engage with Six Four.\\'}].\\n    Now please answer my question: Will I get a promotion in the next year?.\\n', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'User'}, {'content': 'To determine whether you will get a promotion in the next year according to the I Ching reading, let\\'s analyze the hexagram \"Coming to Meet\" (Gou) along with the changing lines and the resulting hexagram.\\n\\n### Initial Hexagram: Coming to Meet (Hexagram 44)\\n\\n**Hexagram Analysis:**\\n\\n1. **General Interpretation**:\\n   - The hexagram \"Coming to Meet\" is associated with encounters and unexpected meetings.

It suggests exercising caution, particularly in relationships, which can influence career progress indirectly. The idea is to ensure that beneficial, rather than burdensome, associations are cultivated.\\n\\n2. **Line Specifics and Changes**:\\n   - **Line 1**: You should engage cautiously at first.

The advice is to stabilize your foundation and avoid risky work decisions, thereby ensuring foundations are solid before making any big moves.\\n   - **Line 4**: Initially warns of isolation. Yet, once changed, it suggests overcoming barriers by being open to help.\\n   - **Line 5**: This is quite favorable when changed; representing unexpected gifts or recognition.
