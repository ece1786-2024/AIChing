The future is bright, with success depending crucially on individual effort.\\n\\nMarriage and Relationships: As long as both parties hold pure intentions, success and happiness are inevitable.\\n\\nDecision Making: To advance one's career, positive means must be employed to overcome and conquer the maladies of internal discord. One must first eliminate selfishness, sacrifice the lesser self for the greater self, and avoid getting involved in disputes. By doing so, a stable situation can be regained, and in a favorable environment, the prospect of every undertaking is bright.\", 'philosophy': 'The Huan hexagram is a hexagram formed by stacking different trigrams, with the lower trigram being Kan and the upper trigram being Xun. This represents wind moving over water, a force that pushes waves and causes them to overflow on all sides. Ancient observers noted that if there was a pool of water on the ground, it would dry up faster in windy weather than when there was no wind, leading them to realize that the wind disperses the water. When encountering a hexagram with Kan water below and Xun wind above, it naturally brings to mind that the wind above can disperse the water, and so this Kan below, Xun above hexagram is called Huan. However, the wind dispersing the water also turns it into clouds, bringing rain to people. Thus, even though Huan implies the dispersal of water, symbolizing disorganization and disunity, with proactive measures and methods to overcome challenges, one can rectify the disunity and turn danger into safety.\\n\\nThe Huan hexagram follows the Dui hexagram, and the \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" explains it as: \"After joy, people\\'s hearts may become dispersed, and so it follows with Huan.\" The \"Image\" explains it as: \"Wind moves over the water, Huan; the former kings offered sacrifices to the emperor and built temples.\" This indicates that the image of Huan is Kan (water) below and Xun (wind) above, representing the phenomenon of wind moving over the water, symbolizing dispersion and separation. Former kings organized sacrifices to the heavenly emperor and constructed temples to gather and unify people\\'s hearts. The Huan hexagram symbolizes dispersion and provides insights into how to salvage disunity, belonging to the lower trigram. The \"Image\" analysis concludes this hexagram with: \"Across the river, one sees a lump of gold, desiring to take it, but the banks are broad and the water is deep. Hoping for wealth proves difficult to obtain, and through the night, wealth and effort are wasted without gain.\"'}, 'line_1': {'description': \"First Six: Use a strong rescue horse, auspicious.\\n\\nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the First Six is due to its compliance.\\n\\nThis refers to auspiciousness because the First Six, a yin line, is positioned below the Nine Two, a yang line, suggesting an intention of yin being gentle and compliant to yang's firmness.

In this situation, the first six is inherently gentle and weak, in a low position, quite dangerous. However, it correlates closely with the Nine in the second position, allowing it to rely on the strength of the Nine in the second to rescue itself.\\n\\nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the initial six lies in compliance. It points out that the initial six is auspicious because it can follow and align with yang\\'s firmness, enabling it to closely connect with the Nine in the second position.\\n\\nThose who receive this line in a divination are in a dangerous situation that is difficult to resolve depending on their ability.

However, it is situated in the middle of the lower trigram Kan, which is a position of danger. Furthermore, its upward progression is obstructed, and it does not receive recognition or important roles from the leaders in the upper trigram. Fortunately, it gains support from the Initial Six below. Therefore, during turbulent times, even though it cannot find a strong backing, it can still find a place of safety and be sheltered by the Initial Six. This allows it to accumulate strength while awaiting new opportunities.\\n\\nIn the \"Xiangs,\" the analysis of this line is as follows: \"Dispersion flees to its resting place,\" achieving one\\'s wish.

However, the initial nine is at the beginning of the Dui hexagram, which represents a young woman. In ancient times, it was encouraged that well-bred women should \"not go past the main gate or the second gate,\" requiring restraint in their actions to display cultured behavior. If one often went out and did not understand self-restraint, their reputation would suffer. Considering the entire hexagram, the initial nine is active but is compared to the reverse compared nine-two, which blocks it, so the upward movement is obstructed, and it is best to stay at home.\\n\\nIn the Image, this yao is analyzed as: \"Not going beyond the courtyard\" indicates an understanding of when to advance or retreat. This suggests that \"not stepping outside\" implies knowing when to move forward when the way is open and to stop when it is blocked.\\n\\nFor those who draw this Yao, it is advised not to go out recently and best to stay at home. Although this might conflict with your active nature, you need to restrain yourself. Live a reclusive life willingly, embrace solitude, and as long as you do not go out, there will be no misfortune.\\n\\nInitial Nine: Do not go beyond the courtyard, no blame.\\n\\nThe Image says: Not going beyond the courtyard means understanding the circumstances of blockage and openness.\\n\\nThe textual meaning is: Not leaving the house results in no disaster.\\n\\nThe Image text means: Not leaving the house is because of understanding the timing of blockage and openness.'}, {'description': 'Top six: Bitter constraint. Perseverance brings misfortune.

If one persists without change, danger will arise. However, if one regrets the excessive constraint, the danger may disappear.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram\\'s image, the Upper Six is a yin line located in a yielding position, appropriately positioned, but it resides at the highest position of the hexagram and is not central. It fails to maintain centrality, symbolizing the path of extreme constraint that goes beyond moderation. It stubbornly intensifies its constraints without flexibly adjusting, understanding blockage but not openness.\\n\\nIn the \"Image\" analysis, it interprets this line as: \"Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune,\" indicating that its path has reached an end. It highlights that \"excessive constraint leads to bitterness and will result in danger,\" because excessive constraint inevitably leads to a dead end.\\n\\nFor someone obtaining this line, you already have a tendency to be excessively constrained. For instance, while frugality is a virtue, if you\\'re saving money to the extent that you don\\'t eat or dress well, this is overconstraint. Do not over-constrain yourself, as living like an ascetic or restricting your talents at work will be detrimental. The urgent task is to find a middle ground between self-indulgence and self-constraint, because excessive constraint is impractical for both oneself and others.\\n\\nUpper Six: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, but remorse vanishes.\\n\\nThe Image says: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, because the path has ended.\\n\\nThe text means that excessive bitter constraint leads to maintaining the right path brings danger, but there is no regret.\\n\\nThe Image of the text signifies that the danger of excessive constraint is due to reaching a dead end.'}]\n",

The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway.

Mountain Fire Bei consists of stacked dissimilar trigrams: the lower trigram is Li, and the upper trigram is Gen. Li represents fire and brightness; Gen represents mountain and stillness. Bei refers to the luster of shells. The luster and the shells mutually reflect each other, decorating each other with interwoven colors that form a harmonious whole, appearing both elegant and bright. Therefore, Bei embodies the meaning of decoration and civilization. The Bei hexagram discusses the relationship between substance and culture, prioritizing substance while using culture to moderate, achieving civilization with restraint. \\n\\nThe Image says: \"There is fire beneath the mountain, which is Bei. The noble person uses this to illuminate all governmental affairs and dare not rashly judge cases.\" The Image points out: Li, representing fire, is below, and Gen, representing a mountain, is above. Thus, the hexagram with Li below Gen is like having fire beneath a mountain, creating a scenario where mountain and fire illuminate each other and decorate each other, which is why this hexagram is named Bei. A noble person should learn this spirit, handling all affairs of state with clear and upright behavior, and regarding judicial matters, should not make hasty judgments.\\n\\nThe Bei hexagram is among the upper-middle hexagrams, symbolizing decoration, guiding people to manifest substance through outward decoration and return to simplicity and authenticity. It advises people to be sincere and plain, not to crave empty fame. The Bei hexagram reveals the principle of highlighting substance through decoration, belonging to the upper-middle hexagrams.

Explanation of the line statement: \\n\\nGuan: refers to decoration. Zhi: refers to the toes. Tu: refers to walking on foot.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: decorate one\\'s toes, abandon riding the carriage, and walk on foot. The First Nine represents the lower layers of society, who typically do not travel by carriage. As life becomes more affluent, in order to facilitate walking, people begin to adorn their feet. How is it adorned? Trim the toenails, clean the feet, and wear comfortable and sturdy shoes; this is \"adorn the toes.\" Of course, in ancient times, women could also paint various colors on their toenails to beautify their feet.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"Abandoning the carriage and walking,\" meaning it is not rightfully ridden.

Explanation of the Yao Text\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: decorate the elder\\'s beard. Grooming beards, today, is something men often do. Therefore, this idea may not hold much significance for modern people, but it was very useful for the ancients. The ancients believed that \"the skin and hair of the body are received from the parents,\" and thus they shouldn\\'t easily cut their hair or shave their beards. Consequently, beards would grow longer and longer. If not properly groomed, it would indeed affect one\\'s appearance. However, if groomed appropriately, it could also show a manly charm. The ancients had different terms for beards depending on their parts. The hairs above the mouth are called \"zi,\" those below the lower lip are called \"xu,\" those near the chin are called \"hu,\" and those on the cheeks are called \"ran.\" For some ancient men whose beards were too long, they had to make a silk pouch to wrap their beards.\\n\\nSix Two: Adorn the beard. Life Inspiration\\n\\nThe “Image” says: “Adorn the beard,” and align with those above. This phrase indicates that the Six Two yin line resides in a yin position, with a gentle disposition. \"Adorning the elder\\'s beard\" implies that the Six Two line is in harmony with the Nine Three line above, mutually embellishing each other. For one who obtains this line in divination, it suggests that at work, they should support their superior leaders and try to speak positively about them. This approach can earn them recognition from their leaders. The “Six Two” is upright and central, having no interaction with the Five, it solely interacts with the Three. The attraction between opposites is like the beard adorning the chin; they act together and complement each other beautifully.'}, 'line_3': {'description': 'Nine in the third position: Decorated as if dampened, enduring firmness brings good fortune.  \\nThe Image says: The enduring firmness and its good fortune mean eventually nothing can overcome it.', 'interpretation': 'Nine in the third place: Running forward, dripping with sweat.

It describes the adornment of the whole body, using oil to make the skin moist and glossy, and wearing brand-new clothes. Maintaining integrity within leads to good fortune. It suggests that one should not only focus on outward appearance but also on inner beauty. With virtue at heart and the ability to persist in this virtue, good fortune will ensue. In times of peace, a well-dressed, dignified, and charismatic person, who is also kind and pure of heart—whose external beauty is united with inner beauty, truly aligning inside and out—how can such a person not be fortunate? Such individuals are often favored by leaders for appointment and promotion; neighbors and colleagues also seek their company.\\n\\nWe often witness this scene: on joyous occasions, many households begin to paint doors or buildings anew, adorning them afresh. Receiving this line signifies being in such a celebratory situation, indicating the arrival of joyous events and is very auspicious.\\n\\nThis third line is within the Lines of Kan (Six in the Second, Nine in the Third, Six in the Fourth), where Kan represents water, symbolizing moisture.

The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner one seeks to marry. Wearing clean, beautiful new clothes, riding a white horse, what is the purpose? It is not to rob but to propose. In these prosperous times, there is more emphasis on personal appearance when proposing. Generally, each era develops new customs, with such changes reflecting the progress of the times. In ancient times, proposals involved bloody kidnappings, followed by ghostly appearances at weddings. Now, as people have become more affluent, a healthier way of proposing has begun. Wearing clean and beautiful clothes and riding a clean and beautiful white horse, this method of proposing reflects the pursuit of cleanliness and health.\\n\\nThe fourth line is a yin line in a soft position, gaining influence. However, line four naturally possesses characteristics of fear and suspicion, causing hesitation in actions.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"The fourth line is in place, indicating doubt; \\'not a robber, but a marriage alliance\\', there will be no blame in the end.\"\\n\\nThis advises those who draw this line: Although the fourth line is rightly positioned, the heart is full of doubts. \"The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner.\" It suggests proceeding confidently, and eventually, there will be no regrets.

Explanation of the Line Statement:\\n\\nHills and gardens refer to desolate, natural places like mountain forests, metaphorically representing wise hermits choosing to reside there. Silk cloth refers to woven silk. A bundle is a unit of measurement, five bolts of silk make a bundle. The bundle of silk here refers to a gift. Meager: refers to something of little quantity or value.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line statement is: To decorate hills and gardens, using plain and simple adornments, and then presenting a thin bundle of silk to employ a wise person; although there might be some regret, ultimately it will be auspicious.\\n\\nThe Six Five is in the position of the king, and his decoration appears more grand. He adorns the royal gardens, using a large quantity of colored silk fabric. This act naturally has elements of extravagance, leading to some worry. But ultimately, it is auspicious, as a prosperous nation frequently encounters joyous events, and other feudal states often come to visit. By decorating the gardens, the king can elevate his status in the eyes of the feudal lords.\\n\\nThe meaning of the text is: Decorating hills and gardens, using a large amount of silk cloth, brings concern, yet ultimately brings good fortune. The symbolic meaning is: The good fortune of the Six Five line lies in joyous occasions.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the Six Five line is in the ruler's position, but it is a yin line at this position, indicating the trait of a yin line to adopt a conciliatory approach and possess the virtue of esteeming the worthy and respecting the capable. The topmost nine, a yang line, assists the Six Five in the hexagram, allowing the enterprise to thrive. However, in the hexagram structure, the upper hexagram is Gen, representing mountains and wilderness. The topmost nine, being a yang line, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Six Five, indicating it represents either a retired old official or a reclusive wise person. After assisting the Six Five, the Six Five rewards him. Although the reward may seem meager, this act itself surpasses material value, and since such a wise person does not value material rewards, even though the Six Five might appear somewhat frugal, the outcome is auspicious.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line in a divination, it suggests that in your work you encounter difficulties, and someone comes forward to assist you in resolving them. This person is not your subordinate or colleague, nor in charge of the matter, but rather a friend or someone capable outside your organization. After receiving assistance, you should express your gratitude. The value of the gift is not important, just the act of thanking will bring good fortune.\"}, 'line_6': {'description': 'Top nine: The plain adornment is without fault.  \\nThe Image says: The plain adornment without fault indicates that the highest is fulfilled.', 'interpretation': 'Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image states: The white silk adorned with multicolored patterns signifies no disaster, because the Top Nine occupies the premier position in the hexagram, like a person in a high position, content and satisfied.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Peaceful: Those who receive this line must guard against good fortune turning bad, and there may be elders in the family or relatives who pass away. Those in official positions may be promoted.\\n\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\\n\\nFortune: Good fortune has ended, be content with simplicity and comfort.\\n\\nWealth: Direct sale, still profitable.\\n\\nHome: Pure and noble.\\n\\nHealth: Light conversation to dispel heat, possible passing away.', 'philosophy': 'The hexagram of Bì, Line 6. Line saying: \"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\"\\n\\n\"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\" Explanation of the line saying: \\n\\nWhite signifies the color white, which extends to mean purity and the natural color, embodying the notion of returning to simplicity and truth. The meaning of this line is: using white for adornment, not favoring ostentation, there is no harm. White is a modest color, yet its decorative effect is very good. The upper nine indicates the extreme of things, and generally speaking, when things develop to an extreme, they are not good. However, for adornment, it is different, as the extreme of adornment returns to a state of simplicity, back to a simple state. Looking at the way people dressed in our country after its founding, we find that the highest realm of dress was still simplicity. For example, before the 1980s, people\\'s clothing was uniform in blue, green, and red. After the 1980s, as living standards improved, people started wearing exotic clothes, with a variety of colors and a multitude of styles, but looking at it today, the main fashion market is still dominated by simple one-color clothing. And white clothing has always been a symbol of nobility, unchanged from thousands of years ago until today. Blue clothing has consistently been the best-selling clothing, and the kind most people wear. So, the art of embellishment and decoration follows a cyclical process, returning to the beginning once it reaches the extreme.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"White adornment, no blame,\" indicating the upper achieves its purpose. \\n\\nThis advises people: to return to the original pure state, do not use external decorations to beautify. Within the simple and practical form, one can better appreciate the natural beauty of life itself. \\n\\nIf you obtain this line, should you wish to meet someone, there is no need to dress up deliberately; maintaining natural beauty will not lead to mistakes.'}}\n",

This line indicates that before the wild geese migrate and travel far, they gather at the riverbank to prepare for their journey as a group. The young geese, unaware of the journey\\'s hardships, are impatient and thus criticized by others. If one acts with gradual progress, they will not be harmed.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram, the Initial Six is a yin line residing in a gentle position, with attributes of softness and weakness, resembling the small geese with insufficient capability. Situated in the beginning position, it is not centralized, suggesting that actions lack moderation and lean towards impulsiveness, like the impatient young geese eager to migrate but lacking sufficient ability, thus drawing criticism. However, others see them as young and inexperienced and will not be harsh, instead offering help after the criticism.\\n\\nThe commentary from \"The Image\" explains this line: \"The young one\\'s danger—there is no blame.\" It indicates: \"The small geese are unaware of the journey\\'s hazards and are impatient, attracting criticism from others,\" but no real danger ensues.\\n\\nFor one drawing this line, it may indicate youth or recent graduation into the workforce or entering a new, unfamiliar industry.

But ultimately evil cannot triumph over virtue, and thus brings good fortune.

      "To seek wealth, the Water element associated with the Wife/Fortune line should be used. This hexagram is represented by the Grandchild's Metal element signifying the Subject, while the Wife/Fortune line perfectly aligns with the Correspondent line. The positions of the Subject and Correspondent are found in the hexagram's Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird, located at the upper and lower positions of the six lines, respectively, and form a partial union of Shen and Zi. They occupy all the critical positions in the hexagram. The Brother line is an unfavorable element; although it is active, it transforms into retreat, and its residual energy forms a triad union with Shen, Zi, and Chen to create a treasury for wealth, symbolizing transformation from adversity to utility, predicting that the matter inquired will turn misfortune into fortune. Meanwhile, excessively strong robbery of wealth is high during the day and month, which is particularly unfavorable for timing; however, the changing hexagram encounters the Union of Six, fortuitously and transforms the Union of Six Si and Shen into Water, which appropriately represents the Wife/Fortune line. There is another symbol of gaining the Six Union's fortune. Additionally, the transition to the Union of Six in hexagrams often also signifies turning danger into safety.\n",

      "  \n",
      "This hexagram indicates strong and abundant information, showing that the transformations align with the querent's question. The imagery is sufficient, and both the primary and transforming hexagrams point to thriving financial resources. The favorable elements are strong, while the opposing elements are weak. The financial prospects are abundant, and wealth acquisition is effective. Receiving this hexagram suggests favorable financial fortune for the year. While it may not lead to great wealth, steady and gradual accumulation is possible. It is advised to control spending and patiently wait for better financial opportunities.  \n",

      "Decision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.\n",
      "- Scholar Interpretation: Do not deceive, do not speak falsely, be genuine and sincere; conform to nature, and blessings and prosperity will be profound and extensive. Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home's fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family. Health: Maintain exercise, and digestion will occur naturally.\n",

With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping.

Bi means adornment and embellishment.\t\t\n",

The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway.

      "### Primary Hexagram: Grace\n",
      "\n",
      "#### General Analysis of the Hexagram\n",
      "- **Symbolism:** The upper trigram Gen signifies the mountain, while the lower trigram Li represents fire. The image of fire beneath the mountain is metaphorical for illumination constrained by obstacles, urging clarity, prudence, and restraint. This suggests potential success through careful planning and execution.\n",
      "- **Prosperity and Planning:** The hexagram indicates smooth beginnings and minor achievements. However, attention to substantive inner qualities over mere appearances is recommended, which can lead to more significant future accomplishments.\n",
      "- **Caution in Material Matters:** The hexagram highlights the risk of focusing too much on appearances or quick gains, emphasizing the need to build a strong foundation and foster meaningful progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Five Elements Interaction\n",
      "- **Dominant Elements:** There is a strong presence of Water (Wife and Wealth) and Wood (Demons), along with Soil (Sibling) in vital lines.\n",
      "- **Element Relationships:** Water (Wife and Wealth) is supported by Metal, but the present elements suggest balancing to avoid consumption or neglect. Consider the strengthening cycle and ensure resources or opportunities (Water) are bolstered without overstraining other areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Six Relatives & Six Spirits\n",
      "- **Six Relatives Presence:** The Wife and Wealth line appears prominently, suggesting a focus on financial management. Sibling presence in certain positions warns against potential over-reliance or interference from peers or excessive competition.\n",
      "- **Spiritual Guidance:** The Hook Snake on the Fortune line in Line 3 suggests being keenly aware of threats or deceptions in financial dealings, maintaining vigilance, and acting with wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Specific Line Analysis\n",
      "- **Line 1 (Changing):** Indicates a fresh yet cautious approach. The transformation underlines the importance of modesty and restraint while pursuing new ventures.\n",
      "- **Line 3 (Wife and Wealth):** Encourages perseverance through challenges, suggesting that steady progress is rewarded with good fortune despite opposition.\n",
      "- **Line 5 (Originally Wealth, Changed to Parents):** Signals a shift in focus or resources from direct acquisition to perhaps nurturing stability within the home or among dependents. This also involves balancing aspirations with responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Interpretation Summary\n",
      "The primary hexagram \"Grace\" emphasizes the importance of outward appearances aligning with internal substance, particularly in financial matters. It warns against being swayed by quick fixes or superficial gains, urging prudent planning and the development of a robust foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion for Financial Fortune:**\n",
      "The hexagram's imagery and components suggest possible financial growth, although it requires foresight and careful management. You are advised to concentrate on long-term strategies rather than immediate results and to shore up internal resources and capacity. Wealth acquisition appears feasible but may require redressing any internal weaknesses or vulnerabilities first, ensuring all actions align with this thoughtful and strategic approach.\n",

      "Invest time in fortifying your existing resources or skills, emphasizing core areas that will sustain long-term growth. This may include saving or reinvesting into reliable ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Be Mindful of Competition:**\n",

Great good fortune, auspicious divination. It is favorable to cross rivers. The \"Image\" says: The upper trigram of Xu is Kan, representing clouds; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Clouds gather in the sky, waiting to rain, which is the image of the Xu hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram and understands that one can feast and be at ease, waiting for the right time to act.\\n- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams, with Qian below and Kan above. The lower trigram Qian signifies strength and perseverance; the upper trigram Kan signifies danger and pitfalls. Encountering danger with firmness suggests acting with prudence and not recklessly. It is advised to observe and wait for changes; success in one\\'s endeavors is assured.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nGreat Image: Clouds rise in the sky but do not bring rain, suggesting not to proceed hastily, and instead wait for the right opportunity.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFortune: The wise must act according to timing; rushing brings danger.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nCareer: The key lies in assessing the situation, patiently waiting, achieving through tranquility, and avoiding risks. Haste makes waste. One must be filled with confidence, unafraid in crisis, uphold integrity, and turn danger into safety. Even when circumstances are favorable, remain vigilant.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nBusiness: Initially, circumstances are difficult and require great patience to create conditions and opportunities. Act fairly, observe the timing, and adapt to change to fulfill one\\'s ambitions. As success approaches, be even more cautious to avoid a last-minute failure.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nPursuit of Fame: The timing is not yet ripe; patience is required. One should hold firm in their beliefs, unmoved by idle chatter, work on self-improvement, and seek reliable allies, leading to success.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nMarriage and Romance: Be cautious and not act impulsively; gradually nurture the relationship with sincerity and enthusiasm. Though changes may occur, a good outcome is still possible. Both parties should understand the principle of overcoming strength with gentleness.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nDecision Making: The future is bright, ambitions can be realized. However, this requires accumulating strength and waiting for the right moment, succeeding later rather than sooner. The individual possesses strong will and a calm mind. Obstacles and dangers will be encountered along the way, which requires great caution. Face slander calmly, remain calm in the face of disaster, and be prudent in choosing one\\'s path. Being humble and sincere will garner assistance from others, facilitating success. When the time is right, things will surely proceed smoothly.\\n- Scholar Interpretation: Currently, there are numerous obstacles, and progress is impeded; great achievements will come later, and the harvest will follow. For those who receive this hexagram, the time is not yet ripe, and patience is needed; rushing ahead will lead to misfortune.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFortunes: The timing is not yet mature, patiently wait.  \\t\\t\\nFinancial prospects: Capital has not been accumulated, business cannot commence.  \\t\\t\\nHome: Peace and safety are blessings.  \\t\\t\\nHealth: Adjust your diet, health is promising.\\n\\n### Line Information\\n\\n- Line 1\\n    - Description: First Nine: Waiting in the outskirts, one should continue to wait as usual; there is no danger.  \\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" says: Waiting in the outskirts means that one cannot venture forward recklessly.

The crumbling pit trap no longer holds the beast, meaning people have abandoned using this trap.\\n        - Element: xin chou soil, Relation: Sibling\\n\\n- Line 2\\n    - Description: Waiting on sand, there is a slight fault, but ultimately it is auspicious. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Xiang commentary says: Waiting on sand, the sandy ground is soft and difficult to traverse, leading to delays in the situation, and this fault lies within oneself. Although there is a slight fault, the final outcome is still good.\\n    - Element: jia yin wood, Relation: Demons, \\n    - Spirit: Black Tortoise\\n\\n- Line 3\\n    - Description: Nine in the third place: Waiting in the mud brings in robbers.  \\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" says: Waiting in the mud signifies filth and squalid conditions, with danger lurking nearby. Attracting robbers is self-inflicted, yet with careful and prudent conduct, and adapting to circumstances, one can remain unharmed.\\n    - Element: jia chen soil, Relation: Sibling, \\n    - Spirit: Azure Dragon\\n\\n- Line 4\\n    - Description: Sixty-four: Initially trapped in a pool of blood, later escaping from a perilous trap.  \\t\\t\\nThe commentary states: Trapped in a pool of blood, passively awaiting unforeseen fate to arrive, the position of the fourth line is subjected to the pressure from the fifth line; thus, it can only submit to the strong and comply with direction.\\n    - Element: wu shen gold, Relation: Children, \\n    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird\\n    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi\\n\\n- Line 5\\n    - Description: In the fifth place, waiting at the banquet is an auspicious omen.  \\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" says: With wine and food, it is an auspicious sign, because the fifth line of nine is positioned in the central place of the upper hexagram, symbolizing a person of balanced morals, who naturally resides in goodness, and dwells in a state of magnificence.\\n    - Element: wu xu soil, Relation: Sibling, \\n    - Spirit: Hook Snake\\n\\n- Line 6\\n    - Description: Top six: Upon entering a cave-like dwelling, three unexpected guests arrive. They are received with respect, leading to an auspicious outcome. The Commentary on the Image says: Unexpected guests arrive and are received with respect, leading to an auspicious outcome. This is because the whole hexagram has a predominance of yang, which pressures the yin. However, the top six is in a yin position, appropriately situated, resulting in surprise without danger and no significant loss.\\n    - Element: wu zi water, Relation: Wife and Wealth, \\n    - Spirit: Flying Serpent\\n\\n## Hexagram Interpretation\\n  \\nTo seek wealth, the Water element associated with the Wife/Fortune line should be used. This hexagram is represented by the Grandchild\\'s Metal element signifying the Subject, while the Wife/Fortune line perfectly aligns with the Correspondent line. The positions of the Subject and Correspondent are found in the hexagram\\'s Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird, located at the upper and lower positions of the six lines, respectively, and form a partial union of Shen and Zi. They occupy all the critical positions in the hexagram. The Brother line is an unfavorable element; although it is active, it transforms into retreat, and its residual energy forms a triad union with Shen, Zi, and Chen to create a treasury for wealth, symbolizing transformation from adversity to utility, predicting that the matter inquired will turn misfortune into fortune. Meanwhile, excessively strong robbery of wealth is high during the day and month, which is particularly unfavorable for timing; however, the changing hexagram encounters the Union of Six, fortuitously and transforms the Union of Six Si and Shen into Water, which appropriately represents the Wife/Fortune line. There is another symbol of gaining the Six Union\\'s fortune. Additionally, the transition to the Union of Six in hexagrams often also signifies turning danger into safety.\\n## Answer\\n  \\nThis hexagram indicates strong and abundant information, showing that the transformations align with the querent\\'s question. The imagery is sufficient, and both the primary and transforming hexagrams point to thriving financial resources. The favorable elements are strong, while the opposing elements are weak. The financial prospects are abundant, and wealth acquisition is effective. Receiving this hexagram suggests favorable financial fortune for the year. While it may not lead to great wealth, steady and gradual accumulation is possible. It is advised to control spending and patiently wait for better financial opportunities.  \\n\\n# Example 2\\n\\n## Question: A man asks about his daily fortune.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# \\n\\n## Hexagram Information\\n\\n## Primary Hexagram: Innocence\\n\\n### General Information\\n\\n- Description: Hexagram Wu Wang: Favorable and unobstructed, divination reveals auspicious signs. If actions are improper, there will be misfortune and harm, and endeavors will be unfavorable. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" commentary says: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, while the lower trigram is Zhen, representing Thunder. Beneath the heavens, the spring thunder rolls, all things sprout and flourish, multiplying and reproducing — this is the image of Wu Wang. The ancient kings observed this hexagram, thereby inspiring themselves to strive with diligence, comply with the seasons, and nurture all things.\\n- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram involves the overlay of different trigrams: Zhen below and Qian above. Qian represents the heavens, firmness, and vigor; Zhen stands for thunder, firmness, and movement. When movement is vigorous, firm, and positive, the spirit is uplifted, leading inevitably to attainment, but only by following the path of purity and truth. Without falsehood, success will come, and blessings will follow.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Great Image: Thunder moves in the sky, and the masculine energy spreads out, symbolizing truthfulness without falseness.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFortune: In all pursuits, it is advisable to maintain integrity. Those whose actions lack proper conduct will surely invite disaster.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nCareer: It is valuable to have self-awareness and to start from one\\'s actual circumstances without harboring unrealistic expectations. By being grounded, diligent, and careful in one\\'s conduct, unexpected misfortunes can be avoided. Focus on the process rather than the outcome, pursue sincerely, act when the timing is right, and success in one\\'s career will follow.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nBusiness: Avoid forcing things that are difficult. Adhere to market rules, uphold business ethics, avoid speculative mentality, and reject the pursuit of excessive profits. Through hard work and gradual accumulation, success is assured.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nPursuit of Fame: With good motivations and diligent effort, discard illusions, focus on the labor rather than the harvest, and inevitably there will be gains.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nMarriage and Love: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity, and must not take a hasty attitude. It is also inappropriate to rush into anything; let things develop naturally—a culmination will be reached when conditions are ripe.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nDecision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.\\n- Scholar Interpretation: Do not deceive, do not speak falsely, be genuine and sincere; conform to nature, and blessings and prosperity will be profound and extensive. Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home\\'s fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family. Health: Maintain exercise, and digestion will occur naturally.\\n\\n### Line Information\\n\\n- Line 1\\n    - Description: First Nine: Do not act recklessly or against what is right; it brings good fortune.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary says: There are no wayward actions because all actions are governed by will.\\n    - Element: geng zi water, Relation: Parents, \\n    - Spirit: Hook Snake\\n    - This line has changed.

The overall fortune is relatively smooth, but attention to details is necessary to avoid unexpected issues due to negligence.  \\n\\n    Here\\'s the information about the hexagram(s) I got:\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n# \\n\\n## Hexagram Information\\n\\n## Primary Hexagram: Grace\\n\\n### General Information\\n\\n- Description: The Pi Hexagram: Success. There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  \\t\\t\\n  \\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.\\n- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nGreat Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nFortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nCareer: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nBusiness: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nReputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nMarriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nDecision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.\\n- Scholar Interpretation: Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one\\'s capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one\\'s capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan\\'s esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.\\n\\n### Line Information\\n\\n- Line 1\\n    - Description: In the first nine, wearing flower-decorated shoes, one refrains from getting on the carriage, choosing to walk on foot.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Choosing not to ride the carriage and walking on foot is to demonstrate the beauty of the shoes, and thus it is fitting not to ride.\\n    - Element: ji mao wood, Relation: Demons, \\n    - Spirit: Azure Dragon\\n    - This line has changed. Line information after change:\\n        - Description: Initial Six: Wild geese enter the mountain gorge. When one encounters this line through divination, it is a warning about mischievous children facing danger. They should be reprimanded, and then there will be no misfortune. \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Image Commentary says: The mischievous children encounter danger, but because parents rebuke and restrain them, accidents are unlikely to occur.\\n        - Element: bing chen soil, Relation: Sibling\\n\\n- Line 2\\n    - Description: Six in the second place: Trim one\\'s beard.  \\t\\t\\nThe \"Image\" says: Trimming one\\'s beard suggests an elder who does not concede to old age, assisting the ruler in revitalizing the state.\\n    - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: Sibling, \\n    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird\\n    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying\\n\\n- Line 3\\n    - Description: Nine in the third place: Running forward, dripping with sweat.

For one who receives this line in divination, it indicates that the wife has been unable to conceive for many years, but she will never be replaced by another, which is auspicious.  \\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Symbol says: Never being replaced by another is auspicious, as the wife fulfills the wish to live in harmony with her husband until old age.\\n        - Element: xin si fire, Relation: Parents\\n\\n- Line 6\\n    - Description: Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nThe Commentary on the Image states: The white silk adorned with multicolored patterns signifies no disaster, because the Top Nine occupies the premier position in the hexagram, like a person in a high position, content and satisfied.\\n    - Element: bing yin wood, Relation: Demons, \\n    - Spirit: Black Tortoise\\n\\n    Here\\'s my question: Requesting financial fortune analysis.\\n', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'User'}, {'content': 'To conduct an I Ching interpretation for your financial fortune, we will break down the details of the provided hexagram and analyze the interactions of various components.\\n\\n### Primary Hexagram: Grace\\n\\n#### General Analysis of the Hexagram\\n- **Symbolism:** The upper trigram Gen signifies the mountain, while the lower trigram Li represents fire.

However, attention to substantive inner qualities over mere appearances is recommended, which can lead to more significant future accomplishments.\\n- **Caution in Material Matters:** The hexagram highlights the risk of focusing too much on appearances or quick gains, emphasizing the need to build a strong foundation and foster meaningful progress.\\n\\n#### Five Elements Interaction\\n- **Dominant Elements:** There is a strong presence of Water (Wife and Wealth) and Wood (Demons), along with Soil (Sibling) in vital lines.\\n- **Element Relationships:** Water (Wife and Wealth) is supported by Metal, but the present elements suggest balancing to avoid consumption or neglect. Consider the strengthening cycle and ensure resources or opportunities (Water) are bolstered without overstraining other areas.\\n\\n#### Six Relatives & Six Spirits\\n- **Six Relatives Presence:** The Wife and Wealth line appears prominently, suggesting a focus on financial management. Sibling presence in certain positions warns against potential over-reliance or interference from peers or excessive competition.\\n- **Spiritual Guidance:** The Hook Snake on the Fortune line in Line 3 suggests being keenly aware of threats or deceptions in financial dealings, maintaining vigilance, and acting with wisdom.\\n\\n#### Specific Line Analysis\\n- **Line 1 (Changing):** Indicates a fresh yet cautious approach. The transformation underlines the importance of modesty and restraint while pursuing new ventures.\\n- **Line 3 (Wife and Wealth):** Encourages perseverance through challenges, suggesting that steady progress is rewarded with good fortune despite opposition.\\n- **Line 5 (Originally Wealth, Changed to Parents):** Signals a shift in focus or resources from direct acquisition to perhaps nurturing stability within the home or among dependents.
