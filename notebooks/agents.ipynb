      "    The process of reinforcing the well's structure with bricks ensures its stability and smooth functioning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    **From the Image Commentary:**  \n",

      "\n",
      "    ---\n",
      "\n",
      "    ### Interpretations from Various Scholars:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. **Shao Yong (Northern Song Dynasty Yijing Scholar):**  \n",
      "    - *Outcome:* Those who receive this line should remain content and disciplined. There may be joy in moving to a new residence. For those in public office, maintaining integrity and personal growth could lead to advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "    2. **Fu Peirong (Modern Taiwanese Scholar):**  \n",
      "    - *Fate:* Cultivate oneself and establish a reputation, and upward mobility is possible.  \n",
      "    - *Wealth:* Revisiting and reorganizing old ventures should yield profits.  \n",
      "    - *Home:* Renovation or maintenance is appropriate, but patience is needed.  \n",

      "    ---\n",

      "    ### Transformation of the Line:  \n",
      "    When Six-Four changes, the hexagram transforms into **Hexagram 28: Excess of the Great (Ze Feng Da Guo)**.  \n",
      "    This hexagram represents an unusual state where action or behavior may become excessive. It combines the imagery of a marsh (upper trigram Dui) over wind/wood (lower trigram Xun), symbolizing a situation where water overwhelms the wood, leading to imbalance. The interplay of yin and yang lines suggests an extreme or overreaching effort with inner resilience and external gentleness.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "    ### Philosophical Meaning of Six-Four in Jing (The Well) Hexagram:  \n",
      "\n",
      "    **Original Text for Line Six-Four:**  \n",
      "    - \"The well's wall is made of bricks, ensuring no mistakes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Analysis:**  \n",
      "    - \"Bricks\" signify the act of reinforcing or stabilizing the well.  \n",
      "    - The meaning emphasizes the importance of fortifying a critical structure to prevent failure.  \n",
      "    - In the context of the hexagram, the yin line (Six-Four) sits in a position suited to its nature (soft but appropriately placed), symbolizing balanced support and proper maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Key Insights:**  \n",
      "    - Six-Four connects with both Nine-Five above and Nine-Three below. While it lacks the strength to provide expansive benefit, its role in maintaining and nurturing the well’s structure ensures functionality without error.  \n",
      "    - The placement symbolizes the well’s central structure—critical for its purpose. Any oversight or neglect here could result in disaster, so timely repair and strengthening are essential.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    In essence, the line advises maintaining one's foundational responsibilities with care to avoid future troubles.\n",
      "    \n",

    "    ### Transformation of the Line:  \n",
    "    When Six-Four changes, the hexagram transforms into **Hexagram 28: Excess of the Great (Ze Feng Da Guo)**.  \n",
    "    This hexagram represents an unusual state where action or behavior may become excessive. It combines the imagery of a marsh (upper trigram Dui) over wind/wood (lower trigram Xun), symbolizing a situation where water overwhelms the wood, leading to imbalance. The interplay of yin and yang lines suggests an extreme or overreaching effort with inner resilience and external gentleness.\n",

    "    ### Philosophical Meaning of Six-Four in Jing (The Well) Hexagram:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Original Text for Line Six-Four:**  \n",
    "    - \"The well's wall is made of bricks, ensuring no mistakes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Analysis:**  \n",
    "    - \"Bricks\" signify the act of reinforcing or stabilizing the well.  \n",
    "    - The meaning emphasizes the importance of fortifying a critical structure to prevent failure.  \n",
    "    - In the context of the hexagram, the yin line (Six-Four) sits in a position suited to its nature (soft but appropriately placed), symbolizing balanced support and proper maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Key Insights:**  \n",
    "    - Six-Four connects with both Nine-Five above and Nine-Three below. While it lacks the strength to provide expansive benefit, its role in maintaining and nurturing the well’s structure ensures functionality without error.  \n",
    "    - The placement symbolizes the well’s central structure—critical for its purpose. Any oversight or neglect here could result in disaster, so timely repair and strengthening are essential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    In essence, the line advises maintaining one's foundational responsibilities with care to avoid future troubles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Focus on self-development and prepare for the future. Trust in the success of those who are actively working on themselves.\n",
