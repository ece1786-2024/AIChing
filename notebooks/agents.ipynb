This represents wind moving over water, a force that pushes waves and causes them to overflow on all sides. Ancient observers noted that if there was a pool of water on the ground, it would dry up faster in windy weather than when there was no wind, leading them to realize that the wind disperses the water. When encountering a hexagram with Kan water below and Xun wind above, it naturally brings to mind that the wind above can disperse the water, and so this Kan below, Xun above hexagram is called Huan. However, the wind dispersing the water also turns it into clouds, bringing rain to people. Thus, even though Huan implies the dispersal of water, symbolizing disorganization and disunity, with proactive measures and methods to overcome challenges, one can rectify the disunity and turn danger into safety.\\n\\nThe Huan hexagram follows the Dui hexagram, and the \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" explains it as: \"After joy, people\\'s hearts may become dispersed, and so it follows with Huan.\" The \"Image\" explains it as: \"Wind moves over the water, Huan; the former kings offered sacrifices to the emperor and built temples.\" This indicates that the image of Huan is Kan (water) below and Xun (wind) above, representing the phenomenon of wind moving over the water, symbolizing dispersion and separation. Former kings organized sacrifices to the heavenly emperor and constructed temples to gather and unify people\\'s hearts. The Huan hexagram symbolizes dispersion and provides insights into how to salvage disunity, belonging to the lower trigram.

It is gentle in nature yet discontent with the current situation. It does not interact with the six in the fifth, but it corresponds directly with the nine in the uppermost position.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image explains it this way: \"Dispersion affects one\\'s self,\" indicating that the ambition lies outside.

However, the initial nine is at the beginning of the Dui hexagram, which represents a young woman. In ancient times, it was encouraged that well-bred women should \"not go past the main gate or the second gate,\" requiring restraint in their actions to display cultured behavior. If one often went out and did not understand self-restraint, their reputation would suffer. Considering the entire hexagram, the initial nine is active but is compared to the reverse compared nine-two, which blocks it, so the upward movement is obstructed, and it is best to stay at home.\\n\\nIn the Image, this yao is analyzed as: \"Not going beyond the courtyard\" indicates an understanding of when to advance or retreat. This suggests that \"not stepping outside\" implies knowing when to move forward when the way is open and to stop when it is blocked.\\n\\nFor those who draw this Yao, it is advised not to go out recently and best to stay at home. Although this might conflict with your active nature, you need to restrain yourself. Live a reclusive life willingly, embrace solitude, and as long as you do not go out, there will be no misfortune.\\n\\nInitial Nine: Do not go beyond the courtyard, no blame.\\n\\nThe Image says: Not going beyond the courtyard means understanding the circumstances of blockage and openness.\\n\\nThe textual meaning is: Not leaving the house results in no disaster.\\n\\nThe Image text means: Not leaving the house is because of understanding the timing of blockage and openness.'}, {'description': 'Top six: Bitter constraint. Perseverance brings misfortune.

If one persists without change, danger will arise. However, if one regrets the excessive constraint, the danger may disappear.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram\\'s image, the Upper Six is a yin line located in a yielding position, appropriately positioned, but it resides at the highest position of the hexagram and is not central. It fails to maintain centrality, symbolizing the path of extreme constraint that goes beyond moderation. It stubbornly intensifies its constraints without flexibly adjusting, understanding blockage but not openness.\\n\\nIn the \"Image\" analysis, it interprets this line as: \"Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune,\" indicating that its path has reached an end. It highlights that \"excessive constraint leads to bitterness and will result in danger,\" because excessive constraint inevitably leads to a dead end.\\n\\nFor someone obtaining this line, you already have a tendency to be excessively constrained. For instance, while frugality is a virtue, if you\\'re saving money to the extent that you don\\'t eat or dress well, this is overconstraint. Do not over-constrain yourself, as living like an ascetic or restricting your talents at work will be detrimental. The urgent task is to find a middle ground between self-indulgence and self-constraint, because excessive constraint is impractical for both oneself and others.\\n\\nUpper Six: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, but remorse vanishes.\\n\\nThe Image says: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, because the path has ended.\\n\\nThe text means that excessive bitter constraint leads to maintaining the right path brings danger, but there is no regret.\\n\\nThe Image of the text signifies that the danger of excessive constraint is due to reaching a dead end.'}]\n",

There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  \\n  \\nThe \"Image\" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.', 'book_DuanYi': 'The hexagram Bi has Gen above and Li below, making it the primary hexagram of the Gen palace. Bi symbolizes adornment, with Li representing brightness and Gen representing stillness. This indicates that there is a civilized system that causes people to adhere to certain standards, thus it is often an auspicious omen.', 'scholar_interpretation': \"Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one's capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one's capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.\", 'traditional': 'This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.\\n\\nGreat Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.\\n\\nFortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.\\n\\nCareer: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.\\n\\nBusiness: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.\\n\\nReputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.\\n\\nMarriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.\\n\\nDecision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.', 'philosophy': 'The image of the Bei hexagram, the symbolic meaning of the Mountain Fire Bei hexagram is as follows. Mountain Fire Bei consists of stacked dissimilar trigrams: the lower trigram is Li, and the upper trigram is Gen. Li represents fire and brightness; Gen represents mountain and stillness. Bei refers to the luster of shells. The luster and the shells mutually reflect each other, decorating each other with interwoven colors that form a harmonious whole, appearing both elegant and bright. Therefore, Bei embodies the meaning of decoration and civilization. The Bei hexagram discusses the relationship between substance and culture, prioritizing substance while using culture to moderate, achieving civilization with restraint. \\n\\nThe Image says: \"There is fire beneath the mountain, which is Bei. The noble person uses this to illuminate all governmental affairs and dare not rashly judge cases.\" The Image points out: Li, representing fire, is below, and Gen, representing a mountain, is above. Thus, the hexagram with Li below Gen is like having fire beneath a mountain, creating a scenario where mountain and fire illuminate each other and decorate each other, which is why this hexagram is named Bei. A noble person should learn this spirit, handling all affairs of state with clear and upright behavior, and regarding judicial matters, should not make hasty judgments.\\n\\nThe Bei hexagram is among the upper-middle hexagrams, symbolizing decoration, guiding people to manifest substance through outward decoration and return to simplicity and authenticity. It advises people to be sincere and plain, not to crave empty fame. The Bei hexagram reveals the principle of highlighting substance through decoration, belonging to the upper-middle hexagrams. The Image\\'s prognostication for this hexagram is: Lately, fortune is vibrant and around; a graceful lady is sought by a gentleman; with the music of bells and drums, great celebrations ensue; good fortune comes to those who encounter it.'}, 'line_1': {'description': \"At the beginning nine: Adorning one's toes and abandoning the carriage to walk.  \\nThe commentary says: Abandoning the carriage to walk signifies the righteousness of not riding.\", 'interpretation': 'In the first nine, wearing flower-decorated shoes, one refrains from getting on the carriage, choosing to walk on foot.  \\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Choosing not to ride the carriage and walking on foot is to demonstrate the beauty of the shoes, and thus it is fitting not to ride.', 'scholar_interpretation': \"Level: Those who receive this line experience much toil; quietness brings misfortune, while activity brings good fortune.

Explanation of the line statement: \\n\\nGuan: refers to decoration. Zhi: refers to the toes. Tu: refers to walking on foot.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: decorate one\\'s toes, abandon riding the carriage, and walk on foot. The First Nine represents the lower layers of society, who typically do not travel by carriage. As life becomes more affluent, in order to facilitate walking, people begin to adorn their feet. How is it adorned? Trim the toenails, clean the feet, and wear comfortable and sturdy shoes; this is \"adorn the toes.\" Of course, in ancient times, women could also paint various colors on their toenails to beautify their feet.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"Abandoning the carriage and walking,\" meaning it is not rightfully ridden. That is to say, the First Nine \"abandon the carriage and walk on foot\" because, according to righteousness, it should not be ridden.\\n\\nFor those who receive this line, seeking to develop a career, relying on others is unreliable; trying to hitch a ride is unfeasible. It\\'s better to make good preparations oneself, work steadily, and advance step by step. Although it may be slower, it is more effective.\\n\\nFor those who receive this line, they should also be aware of a situation where they can originally ride the carriage, but because they have adorned their toes or are wearing a new pair of beautiful shoes, they deliberately refuse to ride to show off. This pretentious behavior and love for display need to be corrected.'}, 'line_2': {'description': 'Line six, in the second position.

Explanation of the Yao Text\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: decorate the elder\\'s beard. Grooming beards, today, is something men often do. Therefore, this idea may not hold much significance for modern people, but it was very useful for the ancients. The ancients believed that \"the skin and hair of the body are received from the parents,\" and thus they shouldn\\'t easily cut their hair or shave their beards. Consequently, beards would grow longer and longer. If not properly groomed, it would indeed affect one\\'s appearance. However, if groomed appropriately, it could also show a manly charm. The ancients had different terms for beards depending on their parts. The hairs above the mouth are called \"zi,\" those below the lower lip are called \"xu,\" those near the chin are called \"hu,\" and those on the cheeks are called \"ran.\" For some ancient men whose beards were too long, they had to make a silk pouch to wrap their beards.\\n\\nSix Two: Adorn the beard. Life Inspiration\\n\\nThe “Image” says: “Adorn the beard,” and align with those above. This phrase indicates that the Six Two yin line resides in a yin position, with a gentle disposition. \"Adorning the elder\\'s beard\" implies that the Six Two line is in harmony with the Nine Three line above, mutually embellishing each other. For one who obtains this line in divination, it suggests that at work, they should support their superior leaders and try to speak positively about them. This approach can earn them recognition from their leaders. The “Six Two” is upright and central, having no interaction with the Five, it solely interacts with the Three. The attraction between opposites is like the beard adorning the chin; they act together and complement each other beautifully.'}, 'line_3': {'description': 'Nine in the third position: Decorated as if dampened, enduring firmness brings good fortune.  \\nThe Image says: The enduring firmness and its good fortune mean eventually nothing can overcome it.', 'interpretation': 'Nine in the third place: Running forward, dripping with sweat.

Even if there are disputes or conflicts, they will not pose a problem. Officials will maintain harmony with others and can hold important positions.\\n\\nInterpretation by Taiwan's esteemed scholar, Fu Peirong:\\n\\nFortune: Achieve both fame and wealth, with brilliance and luster.  \\nWealth: Financial resources will flow like water, ensuring the sustainability of one's enterprise.  \\nHome: Suitable for long-term residence; a century of harmonious marital life.  \\nHealth: Swimming and fitness.\", 'philosophy': 'The third line of the Bi Hexagram reads: Nine in the Third: Decorated as if glossy, as if moist, and remaining steadfastly upright will bring good fortune.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line is: adorned with a glossy and moist appearance, permanently adhering to the right path, and good fortune will follow. It describes the adornment of the whole body, using oil to make the skin moist and glossy, and wearing brand-new clothes. Maintaining integrity within leads to good fortune. It suggests that one should not only focus on outward appearance but also on inner beauty. With virtue at heart and the ability to persist in this virtue, good fortune will ensue. In times of peace, a well-dressed, dignified, and charismatic person, who is also kind and pure of heart—whose external beauty is united with inner beauty, truly aligning inside and out—how can such a person not be fortunate? Such individuals are often favored by leaders for appointment and promotion; neighbors and colleagues also seek their company.\\n\\nWe often witness this scene: on joyous occasions, many households begin to paint doors or buildings anew, adorning them afresh. Receiving this line signifies being in such a celebratory situation, indicating the arrival of joyous events and is very auspicious.\\n\\nThis third line is within the Lines of Kan (Six in the Second, Nine in the Third, Six in the Fourth), where Kan represents water, symbolizing moisture. In Nine in the Third, it is a firm line in a firm position, gaining prominence. Those who receive this line experience smooth progress in their careers and relationships, but must be careful to adhere to the right path and not become overconfident and complacent.'}, 'line_4': {'description': 'Line four: Adorned, glistening, a white horse with wings, not bandits but a marriage alliance.\\n\\nThe Image says: The fourth line is in its proper place, suggesting doubt. Not bandits but a marriage alliance, in the end, there will be no blame.', 'interpretation': 'Nine in the fourth place: Running out of breath, the sun blazing hot. A tall white horse gallops forward. It is not coming to raid, but to marry.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: The yin line in the fourth place is in its proper position. Knowing it is not coming to raid, but to marry, dispels doubts, and in the end, there will be no calamity.', 'scholar_interpretation': \"Calm: For those who receive this line, it begins with misfortune and ends with good fortune. There is joy amidst worry. Although there are dangers, ultimately there will be peace. For the unmarried, there is hope for marriage. For those in official positions, it starts hard and becomes easy.\\n\\nRenowned Taiwanese scholar Fu Pei-jung's interpretation:\\n\\nLuck: Be content and you will have good luck; next year will be prosperous.\\n\\nFinancial fortune: Sell early to profit and settle.\\n\\nHome: There will first be a funeral, followed by a wedding.\\n\\nHealth: Blockages in the chest need balancing between top and bottom.\", 'philosophy': 'Hexagram Bi, the fourth line: The line text reads: Like adorning, like whiteness, as the white horse swiftly flies; not a robber, but a marriage alliance.\\n\\nThe explanation of the line text: \"Whiteness\" refers to pure whiteness. \"White horse swiftly flies\" depicts the strong and vigorous appearance of the white horse. \"Not a robber\" means not a thief. \"Marriage alliance\" originally signifies marriage, here meaning a beautiful union.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line text is: adorned in simple and elegant white, riding a snow-white steed, swiftly galloping forward. The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner one seeks to marry. Wearing clean, beautiful new clothes, riding a white horse, what is the purpose? It is not to rob but to propose. In these prosperous times, there is more emphasis on personal appearance when proposing. Generally, each era develops new customs, with such changes reflecting the progress of the times. In ancient times, proposals involved bloody kidnappings, followed by ghostly appearances at weddings. Now, as people have become more affluent, a healthier way of proposing has begun. Wearing clean and beautiful clothes and riding a clean and beautiful white horse, this method of proposing reflects the pursuit of cleanliness and health.\\n\\nThe fourth line is a yin line in a soft position, gaining influence. However, line four naturally possesses characteristics of fear and suspicion, causing hesitation in actions.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"The fourth line is in place, indicating doubt; \\'not a robber, but a marriage alliance\\', there will be no blame in the end.\"\\n\\nThis advises those who draw this line: Although the fourth line is rightly positioned, the heart is full of doubts. \"The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner.\" It suggests proceeding confidently, and eventually, there will be no regrets. Those who draw this line may pursue speed, appearing impatient, which requires attention. If you are a gentleman, you might be quick-tempered. However, when interacting with women, it is important to be gentle and strive to maintain a long-term relationship with her.'}, 'line_5': {'description': 'The line six in the fifth place: Adorned with hills and gardens, the bundle of silk is small. There is distress, but in the end, it is good.\\n\\nThe image says: The auspiciousness of the line six in the fifth place brings joy.\\n\\nThe auspiciousness mentioned refers to the happiness of a marriage.', 'interpretation': 'Nine in the fifth place: Fleeing to the hills and gardens, offering great quantities of cloth and silk, initially encountering difficulties, but eventually proceeding smoothly.\\nThe Commentary on the Image says:', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Good fortune: Those who receive this line will encounter noble people, gain profits in business, and experience many joyful events.

Explanation of the Line Statement:\\n\\nHills and gardens refer to desolate, natural places like mountain forests, metaphorically representing wise hermits choosing to reside there. Silk cloth refers to woven silk. A bundle is a unit of measurement, five bolts of silk make a bundle. The bundle of silk here refers to a gift. Meager: refers to something of little quantity or value.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line statement is: To decorate hills and gardens, using plain and simple adornments, and then presenting a thin bundle of silk to employ a wise person; although there might be some regret, ultimately it will be auspicious.\\n\\nThe Six Five is in the position of the king, and his decoration appears more grand. He adorns the royal gardens, using a large quantity of colored silk fabric. This act naturally has elements of extravagance, leading to some worry. But ultimately, it is auspicious, as a prosperous nation frequently encounters joyous events, and other feudal states often come to visit. By decorating the gardens, the king can elevate his status in the eyes of the feudal lords.\\n\\nThe meaning of the text is: Decorating hills and gardens, using a large amount of silk cloth, brings concern, yet ultimately brings good fortune. The symbolic meaning is: The good fortune of the Six Five line lies in joyous occasions.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the Six Five line is in the ruler's position, but it is a yin line at this position, indicating the trait of a yin line to adopt a conciliatory approach and possess the virtue of esteeming the worthy and respecting the capable. The topmost nine, a yang line, assists the Six Five in the hexagram, allowing the enterprise to thrive. However, in the hexagram structure, the upper hexagram is Gen, representing mountains and wilderness. The topmost nine, being a yang line, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Six Five, indicating it represents either a retired old official or a reclusive wise person. After assisting the Six Five, the Six Five rewards him. Although the reward may seem meager, this act itself surpasses material value, and since such a wise person does not value material rewards, even though the Six Five might appear somewhat frugal, the outcome is auspicious.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line in a divination, it suggests that in your work you encounter difficulties, and someone comes forward to assist you in resolving them. This person is not your subordinate or colleague, nor in charge of the matter, but rather a friend or someone capable outside your organization. After receiving assistance, you should express your gratitude. The value of the gift is not important, just the act of thanking will bring good fortune.\"}, 'line_6': {'description': 'Top nine: The plain adornment is without fault.  \\nThe Image says: The plain adornment without fault indicates that the highest is fulfilled.', 'interpretation': 'Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image states: The white silk adorned with multicolored patterns signifies no disaster, because the Top Nine occupies the premier position in the hexagram, like a person in a high position, content and satisfied.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Peaceful: Those who receive this line must guard against good fortune turning bad, and there may be elders in the family or relatives who pass away. Those in official positions may be promoted.\\n\\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\\n\\nFortune: Good fortune has ended, be content with simplicity and comfort.\\n\\nWealth: Direct sale, still profitable.\\n\\nHome: Pure and noble.\\n\\nHealth: Light conversation to dispel heat, possible passing away.', 'philosophy': 'The hexagram of Bì, Line 6. Line saying: \"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\"\\n\\n\"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\" Explanation of the line saying: \\n\\nWhite signifies the color white, which extends to mean purity and the natural color, embodying the notion of returning to simplicity and truth. The meaning of this line is: using white for adornment, not favoring ostentation, there is no harm. White is a modest color, yet its decorative effect is very good. The upper nine indicates the extreme of things, and generally speaking, when things develop to an extreme, they are not good. However, for adornment, it is different, as the extreme of adornment returns to a state of simplicity, back to a simple state. Looking at the way people dressed in our country after its founding, we find that the highest realm of dress was still simplicity. For example, before the 1980s, people\\'s clothing was uniform in blue, green, and red. After the 1980s, as living standards improved, people started wearing exotic clothes, with a variety of colors and a multitude of styles, but looking at it today, the main fashion market is still dominated by simple one-color clothing. And white clothing has always been a symbol of nobility, unchanged from thousands of years ago until today. Blue clothing has consistently been the best-selling clothing, and the kind most people wear. So, the art of embellishment and decoration follows a cyclical process, returning to the beginning once it reaches the extreme.\\n\\nThe Image says: \"White adornment, no blame,\" indicating the upper achieves its purpose. \\n\\nThis advises people: to return to the original pure state, do not use external decorations to beautify. Within the simple and practical form, one can better appreciate the natural beauty of life itself. \\n\\nIf you obtain this line, should you wish to meet someone, there is no need to dress up deliberately; maintaining natural beauty will not lead to mistakes.'}}\n",

This line indicates that before the wild geese migrate and travel far, they gather at the riverbank to prepare for their journey as a group. The young geese, unaware of the journey\\'s hardships, are impatient and thus criticized by others. If one acts with gradual progress, they will not be harmed.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram, the Initial Six is a yin line residing in a gentle position, with attributes of softness and weakness, resembling the small geese with insufficient capability. Situated in the beginning position, it is not centralized, suggesting that actions lack moderation and lean towards impulsiveness, like the impatient young geese eager to migrate but lacking sufficient ability, thus drawing criticism. However, others see them as young and inexperienced and will not be harsh, instead offering help after the criticism.\\n\\nThe commentary from \"The Image\" explains this line: \"The young one\\'s danger—there is no blame.\" It indicates: \"The small geese are unaware of the journey\\'s hazards and are impatient, attracting criticism from others,\" but no real danger ensues.\\n\\nFor one drawing this line, it may indicate youth or recent graduation into the workforce or entering a new, unfamiliar industry. There might be an important task at the workplace that others are planning carefully. If you think such preparation unnecessary and choose to act directly, leaders or senior employees might reprimand you, but recognizing you are new and inexperienced, they will not overly discourage you.\\n\\nThose who receive this line must realize their youthful ignorance or lack of experience and avoid acting rashly. Progress should be gradual. Gather strength and refrain from rushing to express opinions. Observe how others act and follow suit to avoid blame.\\n\\nText of the line: \"Initial Six: The wild goose gradually approaches the shore; there is danger for the young one, there are words, but there is no blame.\"\\n\\nThe Image says: \"The young one\\'s danger—from a moral standpoint, there should be no unexpected difficulties.\"\\n\\nThe text\\'s meaning is: The large geese gradually reach the water\\'s edge; the young goose is in danger but is called back by the older ones, avoiding disaster.\\n\\nThe commentary\\'s meaning is: The danger to the young goose, morally speaking, should not come with unexpected hardship.'}, {'description': 'Nine in the fifth place: The wild geese gradually proceed to the high mound.

Ultimately, no ill prevails, leading to good fortune. Explanation of the line: The meaning of this line is that the wild geese fly up and gradually advance to the hill, similar to a husband being away, and the wife not conceiving for three years. But ultimately evil cannot triumph over virtue, and thus brings good fortune. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the ninth line sits correctly in the position of leadership and maintains integrity. Its proper correspondence with the second line symbolizes a husband and wife maintaining their positions and finally achieving good fortune.\\n\\nThe \\'Image\\' explains this line as \"Ultimately, no ill prevails, leading to good fortune; this fulfills one’s desires.\" It points out that \"evil cannot prevail over virtue in the end, thus bringing good fortune,\" fulfilling the wish for a couple\\'s reunion. \\n\\nFor someone receiving this line in a divination, it indicates that in business, one may encounter obstacles, but by adhering to the righteous path and making efforts to overcome these obstacles, they can finally achieve their goals.

      "To seek wealth, the Water element associated with the Wife/Fortune line should be used. This hexagram is represented by the Grandchild's Metal element signifying the Subject, while the Wife/Fortune line perfectly aligns with the Correspondent line. The positions of the Subject and Correspondent are found in the hexagram's Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird, located at the upper and lower positions of the six lines, respectively, and form a partial union of Shen and Zi. They occupy all the critical positions in the hexagram. The Brother line is an unfavorable element; although it is active, it transforms into retreat, and its residual energy forms a triad union with Shen, Zi, and Chen to create a treasury for wealth, symbolizing transformation from adversity to utility, predicting that the matter inquired will turn misfortune into fortune. Meanwhile, excessively strong robbery of wealth is high during the day and month, which is particularly unfavorable for timing; however, the changing hexagram encounters the Union of Six, fortuitously and transforms the Union of Six Si and Shen into Water, which appropriately represents the Wife/Fortune line. There is another symbol of gaining the Six Union's fortune. Additionally, the transition to the Union of Six in hexagrams often also signifies turning danger into safety.\n",

      "  \n",
      "This hexagram indicates strong and abundant information, showing that the transformations align with the querent's question. The imagery is sufficient, and both the primary and transforming hexagrams point to thriving financial resources. The favorable elements are strong, while the opposing elements are weak. The financial prospects are abundant, and wealth acquisition is effective. Receiving this hexagram suggests favorable financial fortune for the year. While it may not lead to great wealth, steady and gradual accumulation is possible. It is advised to control spending and patiently wait for better financial opportunities.  \n",

However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home's fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family.

With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.\n",
      "- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.\t\t\n",

      "### Example 1 Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "**Primary Hexagram: Waiting (Nourishment)**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **General Analysis:**\n",
      "  - The hexagram's imagery suggests patience and prudence, as it illustrates a scenario of gathering strength without rushing. Prosperity is assured by waiting for the right moment.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Hexagram Structure:**\n",
      "  - **Upper Trigram (Kan - Water):** Represents danger and unpredictability.\n",
      "  - **Lower Trigram (Qian - Heaven):** Symbolizes strength and perseverance.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The combination advises acting cautiously, highlighting the importance of being strong in times of danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Element and Relational Dynamics:**\n",
      "  - The querying line (Wife and Wealth) is associated with the Water element and signifies potential wealth. Its active position indicates its potential to transform adversity into advantage.\n",
      "  - The Shi line and Ying lines help determine which element or relationship is most influential.\n",
      "  - The primary focus in interpretation lies on Wife and Wealth, indicating the significance lies in economics or financial matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Transforming Lines and Auxiliary Factors:**\n",
      "  - Each line transformation potentially influences the overall reading. For instance, the transformation to Initial Six involves a shift from a position of waiting or potentiality to one where there's considerable caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **General Interpretation:**\n",
      "  - The final interpretation weaves together all these elements: reliable observation in dangerous situations, accumulation of strength, and strategic opportunity awaiting exploitation to favorably influence the financial outlook.\n",

      "  - **Upper Trigram (Gen - Mountain):** Denotes stability and stillness.\n",
      "  - **Lower Trigram (Li - Fire):** Represents clarity, brightness, and transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining Mountain and Fire, this hexagram suggests a beautiful but potentially superficial situation where stability is underlined by clarity and the potential for transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Element and Relation Dynamics:**\n",
      "  - Line and element analysis would focus particularly on structural relationships and dynamic transformations, prioritizing Sibling and Wife and Wealth as key components according to modified transformation positions. \n",
      "  - Elements such as Wood and Water are vital if they appear well associated with wealth-ensuring lines (e.g., Wife and Wealth).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Specific Line Analyses:**\n",
      "  - Each transformation points to shifts in understanding or priority, such as awareness of external beauty via the initial trigrams but urging inner resource development (primarily through contemplating transforming lines).\n",
      "  - The elements in transformation can indicate corresponding results in financial efforts or enhancements, revealing the real priorities behind seeming embellishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Overall Interpretation:**\n",
      "  - Combining hexagram lines and an element-relationship seam implies superficial gains through Heavenly/Cosmic assistance aligning inner quality with visible achievement, reflecting a journey toward material stability rather than instantaneous wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concluding, this structured understanding implies the user is presented with opportunities for gains, underlined by the trigrams (symbolic for stability and enlightenment).

      "### Hexagram Grace:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Initial General Context:**\n",
      "- The hexagram \"Grace\" is formed by the trigrams of Fire below Mountain, which suggests a scenario where visible splendor or surface beauty might overshadow inner substance or long-term value. It is essential to focus on what lies beneath appearances, ensuring that outer charm corresponds with inner worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Elements and Relationships:**\n",
      "- Key relational lines involve the Sibling and Wife and Wealth elements. The shifting dynamics between these can influence your financial outlook by either supporting or obstructing wealth flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lines and Transformations:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Line Dynamics:**\n",
      "1. **Line 1 (Transformation):** This line's transformation from a position represented by adornment to one signaled by risk (Wild Geese entering mountains) suggests caution. It emphasizes the need to start simple and not be seduced by superficial opportunities or external glories.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Line 3 (Wife and Wealth):** With this line as a focal point, the transformation indicates running towards a goal, potentially resulting in both sweat and challenges. However, steadfastness and true alignment with principles assure eventual good fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Line 5 (Wife and Wealth):** This line transforms from offering to a steady position where difficulties smoothen. It reflects long-term commitment and indicates that substantial efforts generate positive outcomes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Interpretation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Appearances and Real Substance:** \"Grace\" hexagram stresses the importance of looking beyond surface-level allure. In financial terms, this means prioritizing investments and endeavors that enhance intrinsic value over flashy, short-term successes.\n",
      "- **Progress and Caution:** While there are avenues for advancement, an emphasis on clear thinking and prioritizing quality over quantity will be beneficial. The financial terrain may seem smooth with minor achievements probable; however, ensure decisions are informed and not based solely on reputation or exposure.\n",
      "- **Opportunity and Restraint:** Adornments, symbols of external success, should not lead to neglecting the solidity of true worth. Seek beneficial alliances that do not exploit superficial appearances but adhere to ethics and integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, your financial forecast reveals a need for integrating external appeal and genuine worth, advocating for substantiated endeavors over immediate gains. With patience and strategic thinking, your monetary pursuits can proceed steadily and beneficially, especially as you navigate the mid-journey challenges by cultivating internal strength and sustainable growth.\n",
