Qian represents heaven, and Xun represents wind. There is wind under heaven, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, making all things flourish. The Gòu hexagram is the opposite of the Guài hexagram, constituting what is called a \"complementary hexagram.\" Gòu signifies encounter, where Yin meets Yang. However, with five Yangs and one Yin, they cannot coexist for long.\\n\\nThe Great Image: Wind penetrates everywhere, and everything it blows upon is exposed, meaning chance encounters.\\n\\nFortunes: The Yin rises and the Yang declines; be wary of romantic entanglements. Obstacles are prevalent, requiring cautious action.\\n\\nCareer: Proceed according to timing and sequence. However, potential crises lurk, with a lack of harmony between Yin and Yang. It is essential to rely on the strength of others, maintain various connections, enhance one\\'s influence, prevent petty people from taking advantage, and strive for a change in situation. It is advisable to prepare early for all matters, wait for the opportunity, and act immediately once it is ready.\\n\\nBusiness: The market is shifting from prosperity to danger; it is wise to withdraw early. Forceful expansion is risky. No upright individuals are helping, while schemers lurk in the shadows. Thus, it is critical to maintain a clear mind, seek reliable partners, and endure while waiting for the right moment for commercial activities to redevelop.\\n\\nFame: A character that does not easily integrate with others and an overly high opinion of oneself can naturally result in distress and unmet aspirations. One should rely on sincere and upright individuals and achieve success under their support.\\n\\nMarriage: Thoroughly examine the moral qualities of your partner and avoid becoming ensnared in a \"triangle\" dispute. Spouses should treat each other with sincerity to turn crises into safety.\\n\\nDecision-making: Favorable. One can develop smoothly in advantageous environments, but must avoid reckless actions to prevent counterproductive results. Furthermore, consistently guard against the entrapment of petty people nearby. Therefore, one should curb evil before it gains momentum, and it is better to remain isolated than to associate with unscrupulous people.', 'philosophy': 'The Hexagram Gou, also known as the Significance of the Hexagram of Heavenly Wind Gou\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram is a hexagram of different trigrams stacked together, with the lower trigram being Xun and the upper trigram being Qian. Qian represents Heaven, and Xun represents Wind. There is wind under the heavens, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, and all things flourish.\\n\\nGou means encounter. In the Gou hexagram, Qian is Heaven above, Xun is Wind below, symbolizing a person\\'s aspirations and ideals. Just like the wind moves everywhere under the heavens, opportunities for realization will be encountered.\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram follows the Guai hexagram. In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it is analyzed as follows: \"After decision, there must be encounter; hence, Gou follows. Gou means encounter.\" After deciding and departing, one is bound to have encounters, which is why the Gou Hexagram follows. The Gou hexagram is opposite to the Guai hexagram, and they complement each other as \"opposite hexagrams.\"\\n\\nIn the Commentary on the Images, Gou is explained in this way: \"There is wind under heaven, Gou; the ruler gives commands to the four directions.\" This points out that the hexagram Gou has the image of Wind (Xun) below Heaven (Qian) above. It is an image of the wind blowing across the realm, intertwined with all things, symbolizing \"encounter.\" Just as the wind blows across the earth, so should the ruler issue orders that spread in all directions.\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram represents the encounter between male and female. This hexagram signifies news and represents the month of May. Gou belongs to the upper hexagram.

This is an auspicious omen for constancy. However, if one inquires about going somewhere, danger is inevitable, like a frail pig unwillingly dragged back.

The first six is meant to take action but is held back like a pig, resulting in struggle and restlessness.\\n\\nIn the hexagram image, the first six is a yin line in a yang position, losing authority and not centered. The yin energy is prevailing, lacking central correctness. There is an urge to act, but advancing will threaten the yang line, thus \"misfortune is seen.\" Restraint and adherence to the middle path bring fortune.\\n\\nThe Commentary explains: \"Tied to a metal brake,\" suggesting gentle action with restraint. Specifically, it states: \"Tightly bound to the copper vehicle brake,\" thereby regulating its conduct.\\n\\nThose obtaining this line should not be controlled by irrational and uncontrollable emotions, as this leads to losing control and falling into a dilemma. It is crucial to wait patiently, avoiding impatience and impulsivity.\\n\\nIf a woman obtains this line, she should focus on household matters, care for the elderly, her husband, and children, maintaining the household to stay fortunate.\\n\\nFirst six reads: Tied to a metal brake, upright and auspicious. If pursuit occurs, misfortune will be seen; a restrained pig still struggles to move.\\n\\nThe symbolism suggests: Tied to a metal weaving instrument, it means the yielding is restrained by the steadfast.'}, 'line_2': {'description': 'Nine in the second place: In wrapping, there is a fish, no blame; it is not favorable for a guest.\\n\\nThe Image says: In wrapping, there is a fish; the meaning does not extend to the guest.', 'interpretation': 'There are fish in the kitchen.

This represents a noble person who is strong yet gentle. The first six and nine in the second position are closely associated, both residing in the lower gua, symbolizing childhood sweethearts as husband and wife. However, the first six corresponds with the fourth nine. To keep the first six tied, the nine in the second position must impose strict control and foster deeper emotional connections.\\n\\nFor those who obtain this line, do not let emotions and women dominate you; maintain the ability to control your loved ones, and do not open your heart to everyone. Currently, the woman you love remains steadfast in her affection for you even in difficult circumstances.

The meaning of this line is: the skin on the buttocks is rubbed off, making movement very difficult; danger will be encountered, but no major calamity will occur.\\n\\nThe first half of the text for the nine at the third position is similar to the first half of the text for the nine at the fourth position of the Guài Hexagram. The nine at the third position is occupied by a yang line, indicating momentum, but with no positive response above, making it uneasy and immobilized. It\\'s akin to a middle-aged man who has yet to marry, desperately in need of love\\'s solace. However, in this hexagram, only the first six is a yin line, representing a woman. The nine at the third position wants to pursue the first six, but it is obstructed by the nine at the second position. Fortunately, the nine at the third position, being a yang line in a firm position, able to maintain integrity, only harbors affection and has not taken action.\\n\\nFor those who receive this line, the current situation is difficult, and a crisis is being faced. However, if you remain calm, you can avoid entangling yourself in meaningless interpersonal disputes. As long as you are not controlled by the environment and emotions, you can peacefully overcome the difficulties.\\n\\n\"Nines at the third: the buttocks have no skin, advancing is difficult; there is danger, but no great misfortune.\"\\n\\nThe symbolism states: \"Advancing is difficult, as no one is there to support.\"\\n\\nThe meaning in the text is: the buttocks are seriously injured, walking is difficult. There is danger, but no major disaster. The interpretation of the symbolism indicates that walking is difficult due to the absence of assistance.\\n\\nThe nine at the third position naturally desires to seize this first six for a wife, so there is a struggle with the nine at the second position, leading to injury, removing the skin off his buttocks, and making walking extremely difficult. This is the danger caused by attempting marriage by force. However, since the nine at the third position does not lose his life over this, there will not be a great disaster.'}, 'line_4': {'description': 'Nine in the fourth place: There is a basket but no fish.

Health: Deficiency fire is hard to treat, extremely dangerous.', 'philosophy': 'Hexagram Gou, Fourth Line, Line Statement:\\n\\nNine in the Fourth: There is no fish in the wrapping, leading to misfortune.\\n\\nInterpretation of the Line Statement:\\n\\nThe meaning of this line statement is: There is no fish in the kitchen, which will lead to danger.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fourth is in the middle of the entire hexagram and can be called \\'enwrapping\\' the lower line, the Initial Six. However, the Initial Six has already been encountered by the Nine in the Second and is enveloped by it, resulting in the Nine in the Fourth being \\'without fish in the wrap.\\' The Nine in the Fourth is a yang line in a yin position and is situated within the upper hexagram Qian, exhibiting characteristics of restlessness and eagerness. If action is taken, it will lead to calamity.\\n\\nIn the \"Image,\" this line is analyzed as: The misfortune of having no fish is due to being distant from the people. It is pointed out here that the absence of fish in the kitchen leading to danger is like a ruler losing the support of the people; being detached from the populace naturally leads to danger.\\n\\nThose who obtain this line may face setbacks in their emotions; perhaps the person you love will betray you. You should view this as the arrangement of fate, not blame her, nor be excessively sorrowful.

The fall from heaven indicates that noble aspirations cannot be realized, thus sacrificing one's life to remain true to one's principles.\", 'interpretation': 'Nine in the Fifth Position: A gourd grows intertwined with a mulberry tree, with its hidden patterns appearing very beautiful.

Explanation of the Line Statement: Wolfberry refers to the leaves of the wolfberry tree. Descent means to fall or land. The meaning of this line statement is: Using branches and leaves of the wolfberry tree to wrap a melon symbolizes possessing admirable virtue internally, blessings descend from heaven. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth Place is a yang line occupying the position of the ruler, maintaining balance, capable of encompassing the entire hexagram, stabilizing the overall situation. The \"Image\" explains this line: Nine in the Fifth Place embodies virtue, maintaining balance; blessings descend from heaven, signifying unwavering adherence to one\\'s destiny. This indicates that although occupying the highest position, one can uphold the middle path and maintain a pure heart. As a result, the situations one encounters are optimal, needing no rushing around to meet with the blessings bestowed by heaven. This fully illustrates that as long as one does not violate the mandate of heaven, good fortune will be encountered.'}, 'line_6': {'description': 'Top Nine: Encountering its horn, regret, no blame.  \\nThe Image says: Encountering its horn signifies exhaustion at the top, leading to regret.', 'interpretation': \"Top Nine: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn's edge, is not a good omen, but there is no great calamity.\\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn's edge, is because the top nine yang line is positioned at the end of the hexagram, resembling a person in a situation of adversity.\", 'scholar_interpretation': 'Misfortune: Those who obtain this line face difficulties in planning and are isolated and helpless. Officials may achieve great recognition, but their good fortune is nearing its end.

The image explanation is: encountering such confrontation occurs because the top nine is in an extreme position, hence the trouble arises.\\n\\nThis top nine is akin to the oldest bachelor in a village, who no longer has the opportunity to meet someone gentle and feminine. However, because he is regarded as an elder, he is instead confronted by the younger generation. His first adversary is nine-four, who, having failed to secure a wife, naturally complains to his elder: “Why are you so poor, couldn’t you help me get a wife?” Such words are something nine-four would certainly say. The top nine would also be confronted by nine-five, as nine-five is pressured by the growth of the yin line to retreat to the position of the top nine, in such a case, the top nine can only be filled with worries. But why is there no disaster? Because the top nine is poor and old, in ancient times, dying of old age was considered a joyful event, so the top nine just has to wait for death—how could there be disaster?\\n\\nIn summary, the misfortune of the sixth line of the Gou Hexagram arises from not heeding the hexagram’s guidance of “do not seek a woman.” However, getting married and having children is something that no one can stop, and the natural cycle of yin growing and yang declining is beyond human control. Therefore, the disaster brought by the “strength of the female” cannot be avoided.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line, it is important first to understand their real situation clearly. Do not be overly arrogant, and develop good relations with colleagues or subordinates, and make genuine friends. Some tasks cannot be completed alone and require the help of others to succeed. In the face of the immense, unpredictable forces of the world, an individual's power is small. One should only do what they are capable of, so do not think too highly of oneself, or you may find yourself in a dead-end like a bull stuck in a narrow corner, causing your career to reach an impasse.\"}}\n",

Do not refuse, and it will be greatly auspicious. Explanation of the line statement: \"Peng\" was an ancient monetary unit, with two shells forming one \"peng.\" \"Tortoise\" refers to a divine tortoise. The sentence indicates that the opposing side presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a tribute. Do not decline. The meaning of this line is: Someone presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it will bring great fortune.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line occupying a strong position, with a harmony of firmness and softness. Besides being in a correct response with the second line (a yang line), it also connects with the top ninth line. The analysis in \"Image\" explains this line: The great auspiciousness of the fifth line is blessed by higher realms. It points out that the great fortune of the fifth line is entirely due to heavenly blessing. The fifth line, though gentle and residing in a dignified position, still seeks to reduce itself to benefit others. This not only earns broad support from the public but also gains the favor of the heavens. Drawing this line is extremely auspicious, akin to finding jade amidst stone, resulting in financial gain. Perhaps those you have helped previously will begin to repay you. The wealth brought to you is deserved, so do not refuse it. If ever confused, if someone suggests releasing a valuable tortoise, you might do so for great prosperity.\\n\\nThe fifth line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it is greatly auspicious. The symbolic explanation notes that the great fortune of the fifth line comes from the protection of the top ninth line. The fifth has obtained a tortoise worth ten \"peng,\" which symbolizes power. The fifth line is in a dignified position, bestowed by whom?

No blame.\\n\\nSwiftly: Quickly, immediately.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line text is: Try to overcome your own weaknesses, welcome the joy that is about to come, and there will be no calamity.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fourth line is among the mutual Zhen (second, third, and fourth lines), Zhen is associated with decisive action, which further implies indecisiveness. The line text emphasizes the necessity to immediately correct this fault, for only then will joyful events occur.\\n\\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary on this line explains: \"Reducing one\\'s ailments\" is also delightful. It points out that one should endeavor to overcome personal weaknesses and be prepared to accept assistance from others. This act of overcoming personal weaknesses is indeed a joyous thing.\\n\\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it suggests overcoming one\\'s weaknesses. If you encounter troubles in your endeavors, you should minimize the drawbacks quickly to facilitate a turnaround, thereby gaining benefits. If you meet a friend in need of help, while assisting them, you should also point out their weaknesses, and they will surely appreciate it.\\n\\nThe fourth line: Reduce one\\'s ailments, swiftly bring joy, no blame.\\n\\nXiang commentary says: Reducing one\\'s ailments is also delightful.\\n\\nThe meaning of the text is: Alleviate the pain of illness, quickly improve the condition, with no disaster. The meaning of Xiang commentary is: Alleviating pain from illness is also a delightful matter.\\n\\nWhat is meant by \"reduce one\\'s ailments\" here? It refers to the \"in-fighting\" ailment. In the Tai hexagram, the upper hexagram consists of three yin lines, and such a configuration is analogous to the situation we discussed, similar to ten Chinese sharing a space. This scenario easily leads to in-fighting, resulting in a loss of collective strength. What can be done? The only solution is to reduce one yin line to the lower hexagram, and similarly to transfer one yang line from the lower hexagram to the upper. This creates the Sun hexagram. With this change, the phenomenon of in-fighting is avoided, thus strengthening the collective force. This is the meaning of loss being the beginning of greater strength.'}, {'description': 'When three people travel together, one will be lost; when one person travels alone, they will find a companion.  \\nThe Image says: When one travels alone, with three there is doubt.', 'interpretation': 'Line three: When three people walk together, differing opinions are inevitable, and one person will surely end up isolated. When one person walks alone, feeling lonely and helpless, they will proactively invite others to join them. \\n\\nThe Commentary on the Image says: When one person walks alone, they make decisions on their own, and nothing hinders their actions. When three people walk together, they each adhere to their own views, leading to the growth of doubt.', 'scholar_interpretation': \"Level: Those who receive this line should cooperate in their endeavors and will find many benefits; unmarried individuals will find partners.

When one acts alone, he can meet like-minded friends. The Image Commentary analyzes this line as follows: When one walks alone, with three there is doubt. It points out that when three people proceed together, one of them may suffer harm; acting alone can lead to finding companions with shared interests. This indicates that collective efforts should not be rushed without considering the situation; effectiveness and practicality must be prioritized.\\n\\nFor those divining this line, it suggests not engaging too many partners when undertaking tasks; otherwise, conflicts and differences may arise, causing discord. If acting alone, one can proceed while seeking like-minded companions, thus gaining their support.\\n\\nFor individuals drawing this line, it is advised to concentrate on their tasks without having too many thoughts or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. Managing too much can lead to failure, incurring losses. Focus and having one\\'s own opinion are crucial, rather than blindly following others.\\n\\nThe Image Meaning explains that walking alone finds friends, since with three people, doubts arise. \"Three people walking\" refers to the lower three yang lines of the Tai Hexagram, and \"losing one\" means the ninth line of Tai leaves its position to join the ninth line of Diminishing. \"One person walking\" refers to the second yang line of Tai moving to the upper line position in Diminishing. \"Finding his companion\" indicates the upper ninth line of Diminishing corresponds with the fifth six line and resonates with the third six line.\\n\\nFundamentally, this line reflects a human weakness. For example, it\\'s said in the West that one Chinese person can defeat one Japanese person, but ten Chinese might not defeat ten Japanese. Why is this? Because situations occur like \"two people walking, one loses out.\" Among ten Chinese, internal conflict often arises, making it difficult to collectively rival the other group. This illustrates that human weaknesses can diminish the power of collective effort.'}, {'description': 'At the beginning of Nine: After the matter is completed, proceed promptly, there is no blame, ponder the decrease of it.\\n\\nThe Image says: After the matter is completed, proceeding promptly aligns harmoniously with the aspiration.', 'interpretation': 'Initial Nine: In significant sacrificial rituals, one must promptly participate.

It\\'s appropriate to moderately reduce some benefits for yourself.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the First Nine is at the beginning of the Hexagram of Decrease, indicating the need to decrease below while benefiting above. This must be done appropriately, without excess or overindulgence.\\n\\nIn the \"Image\" it is explained: \"Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed,\" which means aligning with the intention. It is pointed out here: \"Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others.\" Those in honored positions, who are weak, need assistance. Therefore, those in humble positions, full of vigor, should take the lead, not shirk responsibility, and immediately sacrifice their own pursuits to help others achieve greatness. This demonstrates a relationship of mutual harmony with those in high places.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line in divination, if someone around you encounters difficulties, you should promptly offer assistance. Although there may be some loss, it can build connections and leave a good impression on others. However, do not provide all your help; only offer appropriate assistance.\\n\\nFirst Nine: Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed; there will be no misfortune. Consider reducing.\\n\\nThe Image says: Once tasks are completed, swiftly proceed; it aligns with one\\'s aspirations.\\n\\nThe text means: Having completed tasks, one goes quickly, without disaster, only losing a little, like not drinking much. The Image means: Upon completing tasks, going quickly aligns with one’s intentions.\\n\\nThe First Nine and Six Four correspond, like Six Four hosting a banquet and inviting the First Nine. The First Nine, due to being preoccupied, finishes the work at hand and then goes to the banquet, only to arrive somewhat late after others have eaten and drunk, leaving just remains. This type of loss is merely missing out on some drinks, thus not leading to disaster. The intent of the First Nine attending the banquet was not for eating or drinking, but to engage with Six Four.'}]\n"

One should rely on sincere and upright individuals and achieve success under their support.\\n\\nMarriage: Thoroughly examine the moral qualities of your partner and avoid becoming ensnared in a \"triangle\" dispute. Spouses should treat each other with sincerity to turn crises into safety.\\n\\nDecision-making: Favorable. One can develop smoothly in advantageous environments, but must avoid reckless actions to prevent counterproductive results.

In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it is analyzed as follows: \"After decision, there must be encounter; hence, Gou follows. Gou means encounter.\" After deciding and departing, one is bound to have encounters, which is why the Gou Hexagram follows. The Gou hexagram is opposite to the Guai hexagram, and they complement each other as \"opposite hexagrams.\"\\n\\nIn the Commentary on the Images, Gou is explained in this way: \"There is wind under heaven, Gou; the ruler gives commands to the four directions.\" This points out that the hexagram Gou has the image of Wind (Xun) below Heaven (Qian) above. It is an image of the wind blowing across the realm, intertwined with all things, symbolizing \"encounter.\" Just as the wind blows across the earth, so should the ruler issue orders that spread in all directions.\\n\\nThe Gou hexagram represents the encounter between male and female.

The image explanation is: encountering such confrontation occurs because the top nine is in an extreme position, hence the trouble arises.\\n\\nThis top nine is akin to the oldest bachelor in a village, who no longer has the opportunity to meet someone gentle and feminine. However, because he is regarded as an elder, he is instead confronted by the younger generation. His first adversary is nine-four, who, having failed to secure a wife, naturally complains to his elder: “Why are you so poor, couldn’t you help me get a wife?” Such words are something nine-four would certainly say. The top nine would also be confronted by nine-five, as nine-five is pressured by the growth of the yin line to retreat to the position of the top nine, in such a case, the top nine can only be filled with worries. But why is there no disaster? Because the top nine is poor and old, in ancient times, dying of old age was considered a joyful event, so the top nine just has to wait for death—how could there be disaster?\\n\\nIn summary, the misfortune of the sixth line of the Gou Hexagram arises from not heeding the hexagram’s guidance of “do not seek a woman.” However, getting married and having children is something that no one can stop, and the natural cycle of yin growing and yang declining is beyond human control. Therefore, the disaster brought by the “strength of the female” cannot be avoided.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line, it is important first to understand their real situation clearly. Do not be overly arrogant, and develop good relations with colleagues or subordinates, and make genuine friends. Some tasks cannot be completed alone and require the help of others to succeed. In the face of the immense, unpredictable forces of the world, an individual's power is small. One should only do what they are capable of, so do not think too highly of oneself, or you may find yourself in a dead-end like a bull stuck in a narrow corner, causing your career to reach an impasse.\"}}.\n",

Those in official positions will receive praise and promotion from leaders. Scholars will achieve excellent results.\\n\\nExplanation by Taiwan national scholar Fu Peirong:\\nTiming and Fate: Greatly favorable fortune, unexpected assistance.\\nFinancial Luck: Profits come automatically, no need to refuse.\\nHome and Household: Prosperous family business; a union made in heaven.\\nHealth: Recovery from illness brings wealth.', 'philosophy': 'Fifth line of the Hexagram Sun, the line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a gift. Do not refuse, and it will be greatly auspicious. Explanation of the line statement: \"Peng\" was an ancient monetary unit, with two shells forming one \"peng.\" \"Tortoise\" refers to a divine tortoise. The sentence indicates that the opposing side presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a tribute. Do not decline. The meaning of this line is: Someone presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it will bring great fortune.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line occupying a strong position, with a harmony of firmness and softness. Besides being in a correct response with the second line (a yang line), it also connects with the top ninth line. The analysis in \"Image\" explains this line: The great auspiciousness of the fifth line is blessed by higher realms. It points out that the great fortune of the fifth line is entirely due to heavenly blessing. The fifth line, though gentle and residing in a dignified position, still seeks to reduce itself to benefit others. This not only earns broad support from the public but also gains the favor of the heavens. Drawing this line is extremely auspicious, akin to finding jade amidst stone, resulting in financial gain. Perhaps those you have helped previously will begin to repay you. The wealth brought to you is deserved, so do not refuse it. If ever confused, if someone suggests releasing a valuable tortoise, you might do so for great prosperity.\\n\\nThe fifth line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it is greatly auspicious. The symbolic explanation notes that the great fortune of the fifth line comes from the protection of the top ninth line. The fifth has obtained a tortoise worth ten \"peng,\" which symbolizes power. The fifth line is in a dignified position, bestowed by whom? By the top ninth line, who comes from the third line of Tai Hexagram to the top ninth line of Sun Hexagram to assist the fifth line in consolidating power. Thus, the fifth line should not refuse but must properly exercise its power to achieve great fortune.'}, {'description': \"Line Six of the Fourth Hexagram: By reducing one's haste, allowing for rapid joy, there is no fault.  \\nThe Image says: To reduce one's haste is also a cause for joy.\", 'interpretation': 'Line four: To eliminate illness, quickly seek the aid of shamans and make offerings to the spirits, and the sickness will improve, ensuring there will be no misfortune.  \\nThe Image says: \"Seeking the aid of shamans and making offerings to the spirits to eliminate illness\" is indeed a cause for rejoicing.', 'scholar_interpretation': 'Obtaining this line signifies many celebratory events.

No blame.\\n\\nSwiftly: Quickly, immediately.\\n\\nThe meaning of this line text is: Try to overcome your own weaknesses, welcome the joy that is about to come, and there will be no calamity.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fourth line is among the mutual Zhen (second, third, and fourth lines), Zhen is associated with decisive action, which further implies indecisiveness. The line text emphasizes the necessity to immediately correct this fault, for only then will joyful events occur.\\n\\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary on this line explains: \"Reducing one\\'s ailments\" is also delightful. It points out that one should endeavor to overcome personal weaknesses and be prepared to accept assistance from others. This act of overcoming personal weaknesses is indeed a joyous thing.\\n\\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it suggests overcoming one\\'s weaknesses. If you encounter troubles in your endeavors, you should minimize the drawbacks quickly to facilitate a turnaround, thereby gaining benefits.

The meaning of Xiang commentary is: Alleviating pain from illness is also a delightful matter.\\n\\nWhat is meant by \"reduce one\\'s ailments\" here? It refers to the \"in-fighting\" ailment. In the Tai hexagram, the upper hexagram consists of three yin lines, and such a configuration is analogous to the situation we discussed, similar to ten Chinese sharing a space. This scenario easily leads to in-fighting, resulting in a loss of collective strength. What can be done? The only solution is to reduce one yin line to the lower hexagram, and similarly to transfer one yang line from the lower hexagram to the upper. This creates the Sun hexagram. With this change, the phenomenon of in-fighting is avoided, thus strengthening the collective force. This is the meaning of loss being the beginning of greater strength.'}, {'description': 'When three people travel together, one will be lost; when one person travels alone, they will find a companion.  \\nThe Image says: When one travels alone, with three there is doubt.', 'interpretation': 'Line three: When three people walk together, differing opinions are inevitable, and one person will surely end up isolated.

When one acts alone, he can meet like-minded friends. The Image Commentary analyzes this line as follows: When one walks alone, with three there is doubt. It points out that when three people proceed together, one of them may suffer harm; acting alone can lead to finding companions with shared interests. This indicates that collective efforts should not be rushed without considering the situation; effectiveness and practicality must be prioritized.\\n\\nFor those divining this line, it suggests not engaging too many partners when undertaking tasks; otherwise, conflicts and differences may arise, causing discord. If acting alone, one can proceed while seeking like-minded companions, thus gaining their support.\\n\\nFor individuals drawing this line, it is advised to concentrate on their tasks without having too many thoughts or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. Managing too much can lead to failure, incurring losses. Focus and having one\\'s own opinion are crucial, rather than blindly following others.\\n\\nThe Image Meaning explains that walking alone finds friends, since with three people, doubts arise. \"Three people walking\" refers to the lower three yang lines of the Tai Hexagram, and \"losing one\" means the ninth line of Tai leaves its position to join the ninth line of Diminishing. \"One person walking\" refers to the second yang line of Tai moving to the upper line position in Diminishing. \"Finding his companion\" indicates the upper ninth line of Diminishing corresponds with the fifth six line and resonates with the third six line.\\n\\nFundamentally, this line reflects a human weakness. For example, it\\'s said in the West that one Chinese person can defeat one Japanese person, but ten Chinese might not defeat ten Japanese. Why is this? Because situations occur like \"two people walking, one loses out.\" Among ten Chinese, internal conflict often arises, making it difficult to collectively rival the other group. This illustrates that human weaknesses can diminish the power of collective effort.'}, {'description': 'At the beginning of Nine: After the matter is completed, proceed promptly, there is no blame, ponder the decrease of it.\\n\\nThe Image says: After the matter is completed, proceeding promptly aligns harmoniously with the aspiration.', 'interpretation': 'Initial Nine: In significant sacrificial rituals, one must promptly participate.

However, appropriately consider reducing some of your own benefits.\\n\\n\"Already\": to stop. \"Swiftly\": quickly and promptly. \"Consider\": appropriately.\\n\\nThe meaning of the line text is: Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others; there will be no disaster. It\\'s appropriate to moderately reduce some benefits for yourself.\\n\\nFrom the hexagram image, the First Nine is at the beginning of the Hexagram of Decrease, indicating the need to decrease below while benefiting above. This must be done appropriately, without excess or overindulgence.\\n\\nIn the \"Image\" it is explained: \"Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed,\" which means aligning with the intention. It is pointed out here: \"Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others.\" Those in honored positions, who are weak, need assistance. Therefore, those in humble positions, full of vigor, should take the lead, not shirk responsibility, and immediately sacrifice their own pursuits to help others achieve greatness. This demonstrates a relationship of mutual harmony with those in high places.\\n\\nFor those receiving this line in divination, if someone around you encounters difficulties, you should promptly offer assistance. Although there may be some loss, it can build connections and leave a good impression on others. However, do not provide all your help; only offer appropriate assistance.\\n\\nFirst Nine: Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed; there will be no misfortune. Consider reducing.\\n\\nThe Image says: Once tasks are completed, swiftly proceed; it aligns with one\\'s aspirations.\\n\\nThe text means: Having completed tasks, one goes quickly, without disaster, only losing a little, like not drinking much. The Image means: Upon completing tasks, going quickly aligns with one’s intentions.\\n\\nThe First Nine and Six Four correspond, like Six Four hosting a banquet and inviting the First Nine. The First Nine, due to being preoccupied, finishes the work at hand and then goes to the banquet, only to arrive somewhat late after others have eaten and drunk, leaving just remains.

The intent of the First Nine attending the banquet was not for eating or drinking, but to engage with Six Four.'}].\n",

When encountering this hexagram through divination, it is unfavorable for marrying a woman.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven; the lower trigram is Xun, which represents Wind. Thus, it signifies wind under Heaven, which is the image of the Gou hexagram. Observing this image, the ruler is inspired to emulate the wind\\'s way of touching all things gently, spreading teachings and enlightenment across the world, and proclaiming it to the four corners.\", \\'book_DuanYi\\': \\'The Gòu Hexagram has Qián above and Xùn below, consisting of one yin and five yang, belonging to the initial hexagram of the Qián Palace. The Gòu Hexagram signifies yin encountering yang, with the soft prevailing over the hard, suggesting an unexpected encounter. However, it is not suitable for marrying a woman. When encountering this hexagram, it is favorable to plan affairs, and if encountering fire, there will also be joyous events.\\', \\'scholar_interpretation\\': \"Yin waxes while yang wanes, and great fortune declines; many obstacles present themselves, and one must proceed with caution. Those who receive this hexagram find that yin prospers while yang weakens, leading to numerous unfavorable circumstances. It is advised to act cautiously and to be especially mindful of romantic entanglements.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong\\'s interpretation:\\\\nFortune: It is the time of good luck, with fame spreading across the world.\\\\nWealth: Travelers afar can profit.\\\\nHousehold: Be cautious of strong winds; marriage is proper.\\\\nHealth: Beware of strokes.\", \\'traditional\\': \\'This hexagram is formed by stacking two different trigrams (below Xun, above Qian). Qian represents heaven, and Xun represents wind. There is wind under heaven, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, making all things flourish. The Gòu hexagram is the opposite of the Guài hexagram, constituting what is called a \"complementary hexagram.\" Gòu signifies encounter, where Yin meets Yang. However, with five Yangs and one Yin, they cannot coexist for long.\\\\n\\\\nThe Great Image: Wind penetrates everywhere, and everything it blows upon is exposed, meaning chance encounters.\\\\n\\\\nFortunes: The Yin rises and the Yang declines; be wary of romantic entanglements. Obstacles are prevalent, requiring cautious action.\\\\n\\\\nCareer: Proceed according to timing and sequence. However, potential crises lurk, with a lack of harmony between Yin and Yang. It is essential to rely on the strength of others, maintain various connections, enhance one\\\\\\'s influence, prevent petty people from taking advantage, and strive for a change in situation. It is advisable to prepare early for all matters, wait for the opportunity, and act immediately once it is ready.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness: The market is shifting from prosperity to danger; it is wise to withdraw early. Forceful expansion is risky. No upright individuals are helping, while schemers lurk in the shadows. Thus, it is critical to maintain a clear mind, seek reliable partners, and endure while waiting for the right moment for commercial activities to redevelop.\\\\n\\\\nFame: A character that does not easily integrate with others and an overly high opinion of oneself can naturally result in distress and unmet aspirations. One should rely on sincere and upright individuals and achieve success under their support.\\\\n\\\\nMarriage: Thoroughly examine the moral qualities of your partner and avoid becoming ensnared in a \"triangle\" dispute. Spouses should treat each other with sincerity to turn crises into safety.\\\\n\\\\nDecision-making: Favorable. One can develop smoothly in advantageous environments, but must avoid reckless actions to prevent counterproductive results. Furthermore, consistently guard against the entrapment of petty people nearby. Therefore, one should curb evil before it gains momentum, and it is better to remain isolated than to associate with unscrupulous people.\\', \\'philosophy\\': \\'The Hexagram Gou, also known as the Significance of the Hexagram of Heavenly Wind Gou\\\\n\\\\nThe Gou hexagram is a hexagram of different trigrams stacked together, with the lower trigram being Xun and the upper trigram being Qian. Qian represents Heaven, and Xun represents Wind. There is wind under the heavens, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, and all things flourish.\\\\n\\\\nGou means encounter. In the Gou hexagram, Qian is Heaven above, Xun is Wind below, symbolizing a person\\\\\\'s aspirations and ideals. Just like the wind moves everywhere under the heavens, opportunities for realization will be encountered.\\\\n\\\\nThe Gou hexagram follows the Guai hexagram. In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it is analyzed as follows: \"After decision, there must be encounter; hence, Gou follows. Gou means encounter.\" After deciding and departing, one is bound to have encounters, which is why the Gou Hexagram follows. The Gou hexagram is opposite to the Guai hexagram, and they complement each other as \"opposite hexagrams.\"\\\\n\\\\nIn the Commentary on the Images, Gou is explained in this way: \"There is wind under heaven, Gou; the ruler gives commands to the four directions.\" This points out that the hexagram Gou has the image of Wind (Xun) below Heaven (Qian) above. It is an image of the wind blowing across the realm, intertwined with all things, symbolizing \"encounter.\" Just as the wind blows across the earth, so should the ruler issue orders that spread in all directions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Gou hexagram represents the encounter between male and female. This hexagram signifies news and represents the month of May. Gou belongs to the upper hexagram. The Commentary on the Images provides this judgment: \"Meeting friends in a foreign land with joy and cheer, knowing that Fortune\\\\\\'s favor grows bolder here. From now on, embark on a smooth course ahead, ensuring nothing will interfere as you tread.\"\\'}, \\'line_1\\': {\\'description\\': \\'At the beginning six: Tied to a metal brake, perseverance brings good fortune.

The first six is meant to take action but is held back like a pig, resulting in struggle and restlessness.\\\\n\\\\nIn the hexagram image, the first six is a yin line in a yang position, losing authority and not centered. The yin energy is prevailing, lacking central correctness. There is an urge to act, but advancing will threaten the yang line, thus \"misfortune is seen.\" Restraint and adherence to the middle path bring fortune.\\\\n\\\\nThe Commentary explains: \"Tied to a metal brake,\" suggesting gentle action with restraint. Specifically, it states: \"Tightly bound to the copper vehicle brake,\" thereby regulating its conduct.\\\\n\\\\nThose obtaining this line should not be controlled by irrational and uncontrollable emotions, as this leads to losing control and falling into a dilemma. It is crucial to wait patiently, avoiding impatience and impulsivity.\\\\n\\\\nIf a woman obtains this line, she should focus on household matters, care for the elderly, her husband, and children, maintaining the household to stay fortunate.\\\\n\\\\nFirst six reads: Tied to a metal brake, upright and auspicious. If pursuit occurs, misfortune will be seen; a restrained pig still struggles to move.\\\\n\\\\nThe symbolism suggests: Tied to a metal weaving instrument, it means the yielding is restrained by the steadfast.\\'}, \\'line_2\\': {\\'description\\': \\'Nine in the second place: In wrapping, there is a fish, no blame; it is not favorable for a guest.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: In wrapping, there is a fish; the meaning does not extend to the guest.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'There are fish in the kitchen. Obtaining this line through divination, there are no calamities, but it is not favorable to host banquets for guests. The Commentary on the Symbol says: There are fish in the kitchen.

This represents a noble person who is strong yet gentle. The first six and nine in the second position are closely associated, both residing in the lower gua, symbolizing childhood sweethearts as husband and wife. However, the first six corresponds with the fourth nine. To keep the first six tied, the nine in the second position must impose strict control and foster deeper emotional connections.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who obtain this line, do not let emotions and women dominate you; maintain the ability to control your loved ones, and do not open your heart to everyone. Currently, the woman you love remains steadfast in her affection for you even in difficult circumstances.

The meaning of this line is: the skin on the buttocks is rubbed off, making movement very difficult; danger will be encountered, but no major calamity will occur.\\\\n\\\\nThe first half of the text for the nine at the third position is similar to the first half of the text for the nine at the fourth position of the Guài Hexagram. The nine at the third position is occupied by a yang line, indicating momentum, but with no positive response above, making it uneasy and immobilized. It\\\\\\'s akin to a middle-aged man who has yet to marry, desperately in need of love\\\\\\'s solace. However, in this hexagram, only the first six is a yin line, representing a woman. The nine at the third position wants to pursue the first six, but it is obstructed by the nine at the second position. Fortunately, the nine at the third position, being a yang line in a firm position, able to maintain integrity, only harbors affection and has not taken action.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who receive this line, the current situation is difficult, and a crisis is being faced. However, if you remain calm, you can avoid entangling yourself in meaningless interpersonal disputes. As long as you are not controlled by the environment and emotions, you can peacefully overcome the difficulties.\\\\n\\\\n\"Nines at the third: the buttocks have no skin, advancing is difficult; there is danger, but no great misfortune.\"\\\\n\\\\nThe symbolism states: \"Advancing is difficult, as no one is there to support.\"\\\\n\\\\nThe meaning in the text is: the buttocks are seriously injured, walking is difficult. There is danger, but no major disaster. The interpretation of the symbolism indicates that walking is difficult due to the absence of assistance.\\\\n\\\\nThe nine at the third position naturally desires to seize this first six for a wife, so there is a struggle with the nine at the second position, leading to injury, removing the skin off his buttocks, and making walking extremely difficult. This is the danger caused by attempting marriage by force. However, since the nine at the third position does not lose his life over this, there will not be a great disaster.\\'}, \\'line_4\\': {\\'description\\': \\'Nine in the fourth place: There is a basket but no fish.

However, the Initial Six has already been encountered by the Nine in the Second and is enveloped by it, resulting in the Nine in the Fourth being \\\\\\'without fish in the wrap.\\\\\\' The Nine in the Fourth is a yang line in a yin position and is situated within the upper hexagram Qian, exhibiting characteristics of restlessness and eagerness. If action is taken, it will lead to calamity.\\\\n\\\\nIn the \"Image,\" this line is analyzed as: The misfortune of having no fish is due to being distant from the people. It is pointed out here that the absence of fish in the kitchen leading to danger is like a ruler losing the support of the people; being detached from the populace naturally leads to danger.\\\\n\\\\nThose who obtain this line may face setbacks in their emotions; perhaps the person you love will betray you.

The meaning of this line statement is: Using branches and leaves of the wolfberry tree to wrap a melon symbolizes possessing admirable virtue internally, blessings descend from heaven. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth Place is a yang line occupying the position of the ruler, maintaining balance, capable of encompassing the entire hexagram, stabilizing the overall situation. The \"Image\" explains this line: Nine in the Fifth Place embodies virtue, maintaining balance; blessings descend from heaven, signifying unwavering adherence to one\\\\\\'s destiny. This indicates that although occupying the highest position, one can uphold the middle path and maintain a pure heart. As a result, the situations one encounters are optimal, needing no rushing around to meet with the blessings bestowed by heaven.

The image explanation is: encountering such confrontation occurs because the top nine is in an extreme position, hence the trouble arises.\\\\n\\\\nThis top nine is akin to the oldest bachelor in a village, who no longer has the opportunity to meet someone gentle and feminine. However, because he is regarded as an elder, he is instead confronted by the younger generation. His first adversary is nine-four, who, having failed to secure a wife, naturally complains to his elder: “Why are you so poor, couldn’t you help me get a wife?” Such words are something nine-four would certainly say. The top nine would also be confronted by nine-five, as nine-five is pressured by the growth of the yin line to retreat to the position of the top nine, in such a case, the top nine can only be filled with worries. But why is there no disaster? Because the top nine is poor and old, in ancient times, dying of old age was considered a joyful event, so the top nine just has to wait for death—how could there be disaster?\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the misfortune of the sixth line of the Gou Hexagram arises from not heeding the hexagram’s guidance of “do not seek a woman.” However, getting married and having children is something that no one can stop, and the natural cycle of yin growing and yang declining is beyond human control. Therefore, the disaster brought by the “strength of the female” cannot be avoided.\\\\n\\\\nFor those receiving this line, it is important first to understand their real situation clearly. Do not be overly arrogant, and develop good relations with colleagues or subordinates, and make genuine friends. Some tasks cannot be completed alone and require the help of others to succeed.

Explanation of the line statement: \"Peng\" was an ancient monetary unit, with two shells forming one \"peng.\" \"Tortoise\" refers to a divine tortoise. The sentence indicates that the opposing side presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a tribute. Do not decline. The meaning of this line is: Someone presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it will bring great fortune.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line occupying a strong position, with a harmony of firmness and softness. Besides being in a correct response with the second line (a yang line), it also connects with the top ninth line. The analysis in \"Image\" explains this line: The great auspiciousness of the fifth line is blessed by higher realms. It points out that the great fortune of the fifth line is entirely due to heavenly blessing. The fifth line, though gentle and residing in a dignified position, still seeks to reduce itself to benefit others. This not only earns broad support from the public but also gains the favor of the heavens. Drawing this line is extremely auspicious, akin to finding jade amidst stone, resulting in financial gain. Perhaps those you have helped previously will begin to repay you. The wealth brought to you is deserved, so do not refuse it. If ever confused, if someone suggests releasing a valuable tortoise, you might do so for great prosperity.\\\\n\\\\nThe fifth line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it is greatly auspicious. The symbolic explanation notes that the great fortune of the fifth line comes from the protection of the top ninth line. The fifth has obtained a tortoise worth ten \"peng,\" which symbolizes power. The fifth line is in a dignified position, bestowed by whom? By the top ninth line, who comes from the third line of Tai Hexagram to the top ninth line of Sun Hexagram to assist the fifth line in consolidating power.

The line text emphasizes the necessity to immediately correct this fault, for only then will joyful events occur.\\\\n\\\\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary on this line explains: \"Reducing one\\\\\\'s ailments\" is also delightful. It points out that one should endeavor to overcome personal weaknesses and be prepared to accept assistance from others.

The meaning of Xiang commentary is: Alleviating pain from illness is also a delightful matter.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is meant by \"reduce one\\\\\\'s ailments\" here? It refers to the \"in-fighting\" ailment. In the Tai hexagram, the upper hexagram consists of three yin lines, and such a configuration is analogous to the situation we discussed, similar to ten Chinese sharing a space. This scenario easily leads to in-fighting, resulting in a loss of collective strength. What can be done? The only solution is to reduce one yin line to the lower hexagram, and similarly to transfer one yang line from the lower hexagram to the upper. This creates the Sun hexagram. With this change, the phenomenon of in-fighting is avoided, thus strengthening the collective force. This is the meaning of loss being the beginning of greater strength.\\'}, {\\'description\\': \\'When three people travel together, one will be lost; when one person travels alone, they will find a companion.  \\\\nThe Image says: When one travels alone, with three there is doubt.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'Line three: When three people walk together, differing opinions are inevitable, and one person will surely end up isolated.

When one acts alone, he can meet like-minded friends. The Image Commentary analyzes this line as follows: When one walks alone, with three there is doubt. It points out that when three people proceed together, one of them may suffer harm; acting alone can lead to finding companions with shared interests. This indicates that collective efforts should not be rushed without considering the situation; effectiveness and practicality must be prioritized.\\\\n\\\\nFor those divining this line, it suggests not engaging too many partners when undertaking tasks; otherwise, conflicts and differences may arise, causing discord. If acting alone, one can proceed while seeking like-minded companions, thus gaining their support.\\\\n\\\\nFor individuals drawing this line, it is advised to concentrate on their tasks without having too many thoughts or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. Managing too much can lead to failure, incurring losses. Focus and having one\\\\\\'s own opinion are crucial, rather than blindly following others.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image Meaning explains that walking alone finds friends, since with three people, doubts arise. \"Three people walking\" refers to the lower three yang lines of the Tai Hexagram, and \"losing one\" means the ninth line of Tai leaves its position to join the ninth line of Diminishing. \"One person walking\" refers to the second yang line of Tai moving to the upper line position in Diminishing. \"Finding his companion\" indicates the upper ninth line of Diminishing corresponds with the fifth six line and resonates with the third six line.\\\\n\\\\nFundamentally, this line reflects a human weakness. For example, it\\\\\\'s said in the West that one Chinese person can defeat one Japanese person, but ten Chinese might not defeat ten Japanese. Why is this? Because situations occur like \"two people walking, one loses out.\" Among ten Chinese, internal conflict often arises, making it difficult to collectively rival the other group. This illustrates that human weaknesses can diminish the power of collective effort.\\'}, {\\'description\\': \\'At the beginning of Nine: After the matter is completed, proceed promptly, there is no blame, ponder the decrease of it.\\\\n\\\\nThe Image says: After the matter is completed, proceeding promptly aligns harmoniously with the aspiration.\\', \\'interpretation\\': \\'Initial Nine: In significant sacrificial rituals, one must promptly participate.

This must be done appropriately, without excess or overindulgence.\\\\n\\\\nIn the \"Image\" it is explained: \"Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed,\" which means aligning with the intention. It is pointed out here: \"Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others.\" Those in honored positions, who are weak, need assistance.

This demonstrates a relationship of mutual harmony with those in high places.\\\\n\\\\nFor those receiving this line in divination, if someone around you encounters difficulties, you should promptly offer assistance.

It often warns against unwise relationships or ventures, suggesting attention to timing and caution. It highlights a scenario where a strong yin element (representative of obstacles or challenges) meets a more numerous yang element, potentially leading to instability or imbalance.\\n\\n2. **Five Elements and Six Relatives**:\\n   - With \"Coming to Meet,\" there is a dynamic interplay between forces (elements). Typically, the hexagram has a strong yang presence with an interjection of yin, indicating healthy ambition and active pursuits being potentially challenged or destabilized by unexpected influences.\\n\\n3. **Line Interpretations**:\\n   - **Line 1**: Implies an initial restraint. While conditions are not hostile, advancing without preparation can lead to complications. The advice is to not act hastily.\\n   - **Line 3**: Highlights a need to avoid making risky moves or advancements due to unstable support.\\n   - **Line 4**: Suggests misfortune stemming from isolation or lack of connections — crucial elements in workplace environments.\\n   - **Line 5**: Presents the situation of hidden virtue, where maintaining righteousness might lead to unexpected fortune.\\n\\n**Changing Lines**:\\n\\n1. **Line 5** (Changed to Yin):\\n   - The transition here emphasizes receiving unexpected merit or recognition (as if receiving a divine gift). There is a strong prospect for something significant being acknowledged or rewarded, such as a promotion or recognition at work.\\n\\n2. **Line 4** (Changed to Yin):\\n   - Signals a remedy for misfortune, wherein seeking the right directions or support (spiritual or mentorship) leads to positive results. It suggests being open to advice and assistance can transform misfortunes into celebrations.\\n\\n3. **Line 3** (Changed to Yin):\\n   - Cautions not to be rash. Working collectively and focusing on forming cohesive strategies or partnerships is advised.
