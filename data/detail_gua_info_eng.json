Each is in its respective position, which implies non-interaction and no connection with the outside world. The positions are fixed and unchanging, adhering to established customs and outdated practices. The \"Pi\" hexagram signifies obstruction, blockage, deterioration, and denouncement. It implies a self-imposed isolation that hinders progress.\n\nThe \"Pi\" hexagram is unfavorable to the noble person (junzi), as it indicates a tendency for petty individuals to gain power while noble individuals must withdraw. Petty individuals block the path of noble ones, because Kun belongs to the inner trigram and Qian to the outer trigram, suggesting that petty individuals dominate internal affairs, while noble individuals are relegated to the exterior. In this scenario, petty individuals gain power, and noble individuals face exclusion.\n\nThe Pi hexagram follows the Tai hexagram. The \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" explains it as: \"Things cannot continuously be accessible, thus leading to Pi.\" Eternal communication and accessibility are impossible, hence the occurrence of obstruction, which brings us to the discussion of the Pi hexagram.\n\nThe \"Image\" says: Heaven and Earth do not interact, forming \"Pi\"; the noble person employs frugality and moral integrity to avoid difficulties, not seeking honor through official emolument. \n\nThe \"Image\" points out: The hexagram image of Pi is Kun (Earth) below and Qian (Heaven) above, symbolizing Heaven above the Earth. Heaven is at the highest point and Earth at the lowest, so Yin and Yang between Heaven and Earth cannot interact, leading to a blocked and impassable era. At this time, the noble person must adhere to frugality and moral virtues to avoid danger and disaster, and cannot pursue high office or substantial salaries, thus forsaking the pursuit of wealth and honor. The Pi hexagram symbolizes obstruction and belongs to the central hexagram. In the \"Image,\" this hexagram is interpreted as: The tiger falls into a pit, an unbearable situation; advancing is easy, retreating is difficult; aspirations are not fulfilled, leading to one's own troubles, with illness and disputes becoming intertwined."},"line_1":{"description":"First Six: Pulling out the grass by its roots, along with its companions.

The result is auspicious and smooth.\n\nThe initial six lines of the Bi (Obstruction) hexagram are very similar to those of the Tai (Peace) hexagram. The Tai says: Initial nine: Uproot the grass along with its kind. It is auspicious when moving forward. Bi says: Initial six, uprooting the grass along with its kind, divination is auspicious and smooth.\n\nThe initial six is a yin line in a yang position, which is not correct. In this position, it is difficult to achieve one's ambitions, so one should not \"advance\" but only \"remain firm.\" However, though the initial six is a yin line in a yang position, it corresponds with the ninth-fourth, indicating a connection with those in power. Therefore, as long as one remains compliant and in line with superiors, one can achieve peace and success.\n\nThose who draw this hexagram should be aware that their current environment is highly unfavorable, and any action may lead to problems. However, it's important to foster friendships without being stingy with resources. By making sincere friendships, you will have support when needed.

Those who receive this hexagram should stay away from petty people. If it is necessary to work with petty people, one must tolerate the humiliation from others, concealing the shame in their heart and serving the petty individuals or officials against one's will.\n\nThis line, the third six, is a yin line situated in a yang position, which causes it to be out of place and not in a central position. The 'Image' says: \"Enveloping shame,\" indicating that the improper position leads to shame. Those who obtain this line can expect to suffer humiliation because their position is not correct, but they should hide it in their heart and not display it. It is best not to mind others' attitudes and focus on one's work. Adjusting one's emotions and revising or recreating one's plans is advisable. If one is in charge of a team, it is necessary to readjust internal and external relationships for harmonious coexistence.\n\nThis discusses a phenomenon when times deteriorate, where people no longer have a sense of shame, and immoral acts occur between men and women. Why were only these two Yao texts written for the third six? Because Qian represents yang and Kun represents yin, and the third six is at the juncture of yin and yang, depicting the exchange between men and women, thus bringing \"shame.\" The yin line in the third six is in a yang position and not central, closely following the fourth nine, which is centrally located within the hexagram, creating the \"envelop\" imagery.

This symbol originated when ancient people observed the mighty rivers. They saw the powerful midstream, like an arrow, split to both sides with waves and currents, represented by \"—\" for the midstream and another \"—\" for the side flows or waves. Combined, these lines form the symbol representing water.\n\nIn addition to symbolizing water, Kan also represents the moon.\n\nThe Kan Hexagram denotes a state of difficulty and danger.\n\nWithin the sixty-four hexagrams, the Kan Hexagram consists of two overlapping Kan Trigrams. Kan represents water and danger. When two Kans stack, danger multiplies, obstacles intensify. One yang is trapped between two yins. Fortunately, when yin is hollow and yang is substantial, honesty and sincerity can lead through the peril. Despite the multitude of challenges, one’s true nature can shine through.\n\nThe Kan Hexagram follows the Da Guo Hexagram, as explained in the \"Sequence of the Hexagrams\": \"Excess cannot last, hence followed by Kan. Kan refers to entrapment.\" The Da Guo Hexagram implies excessive action, and overreaching action leads to danger, hence the subsequent discussion of Kan.\n\nIn \"The Image\" it is explained: \"When water flows continuously, Kan becomes habitual; a gentleman practices moral conduct and persists in teaching.\"\n\n\"The Image\" depicts Kan's hexagram as water below and above, symbolizing flowing water. Streams continue to arrive, waves surging forward, needing to fill countless deep cavities to move forth, thus symbolizing numerous challenges and difficulties; hence, a gentleman must persist tirelessly, advancing educational endeavors repetitively.\n\nKan Hexagram teaches the principle of using and facing danger, belonging to the most perilous hexagrams. \"The Image\" expounds: \"A bright moon reflects on the water, showing only shadows with no trace, where a fool dives to fetch the riches, only to grasp emptiness.\"\n\nThis hexagram is named Kan. \"Shuo Wen\" states: \"Kan means pit.\" Thus, Kan's original meaning pertains to pits and holes. However, such places being reservoirs of water, as \"water flows downward, settling in low places,\" links Kan to water. Circumstances cannot always proceed smoothly and without obstruction; there are bound to be hurdles, hence Kan follows Da Guo. This is as stated in \"Sequence of the Hexagrams\": \"Excess cannot last, hence followed by Kan.\" For this reason, Kan also implies difficulties and obstacles.\n\nHexagram Diagram: The Kan Hexagram is comprised of four yin lines and two yang lines, with the two yang lines positioned within the upper and lower trigrams.\n\nHexagram Symbol: Analyzing from the perspective of the hexagram's imagery, the Kan Hexagram is formed by two overlapping three-line Kan hexagrams, symbolizing one pit after another, one obstacle following another, one danger succeeding another, with flooding waters, disasters abound, repeatedly encountering misfortunes. The upper Kan can represent atmospheric water, such as rain, dew, frost, snow, clouds, fog, and external calamities; the lower Kan can represent terrestrial water, such as rivers, seas, springs, lakes, ponds, and internal catastrophes.

This line indicates that both upper and lower trigrams of Kan are perilous, and the position of six in the third place lies between these two dangers, indicating danger ahead and behind, positioning oneself amidst these two perils. Since both directions are dangerous, unable to advance or retreat, it is better to rest quietly and wait, avoiding rash actions.

Six in the third place is at the boundary between the upper and lower Kan trigrams, symbolizing peril both internally and externally, hence the line statement \"When it comes, Kan, Kan.\" Positioned in such a state of internal and external worries, with danger looming large, it is disadvantageous to act, thus the line statement advises \"Do not use.\""},"line_4":{"description":"Sixty-four: A jar of wine and two sacrificial vessels; use a clay pot.

Qian represents heaven and strength; Dui represents a marsh and joy. The vapor from the marsh ascends, converges into rain, and falls to the earth, nourishing all things. \"Five yang and one yin, removing it is not difficult, just decide and it can be done; thus it is named Guai (also pronounced 'jué'), meaning decisiveness.\n\nThe Guai hexagram comes after the Yi hexagram. The \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" states, \"If accumulation does not cease, it will inevitably burst forth, therefore it is followed by Guai. Guai means decision or determination.\" This suggests that if prosperity continues unabated, it will eventually disintegrate.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" section explains the hexagram as follows: \"Above the marsh is heaven, Guai; a noble person uses this to bestow benevolence to those below, but remains cautious in virtue.\" This indicates that the image of Guai hexagram is Qian (heaven) beneath Dui (marsh), symbolizing the evaporation of lake water to the sky, poised to return as rain. It signifies decisiveness. A noble person gains insight from this: benevolence should be widely bestowed upon the lower populace. If one remains aloof and does not bestow benevolence, one will encounter resentment.\n\nThe Guai hexagram symbolizes decisiveness and is considered an auspicious hexagram.

Explanation of the Line Text: Strong: Firm and rash. Toes: Toes of the foot. Foretoes: Refers to the initial stage of movement. The meaning of this line is: The foretoes are vigorous, proceeding rashly cannot achieve success and instead invites disaster. From the hexagram image perspective, the initial nine is an active yang line in a strong position, prone to impulsiveness, but it is restrained by four yang lines above, making it ineffective. Furthermore, the initial nine is not in resonance with the fourth nine, indicating a return without achievement, potentially causing trouble.\n\nThe Xiang (Image) explains this line as: Proceeding without victory, results in misfortune. Here, it is pointed out: The position of the initial nine is the lowest, it should accumulate strength and wait for the right opportunity, yet it impetuously and hastily proceeds. Marching alone can only lead to failure. Not only does it fail to accomplish the mission of disciplining the petty ones, but it also brings disaster upon itself. For those who obtain this line in divination, if there is no assurance of certain victory, do not act. This way they will not only fail but also invite trouble. It is important to use the mind in actions. Some people have a strong physique and an energetic personality and tend to act with brute force rather than intelligence. Sometimes, acting on impulse without fully assessing their capability and without considering the true situation, they rely solely on enthusiasm and courage, often leading to trouble.\n\nInitial Nine: Strength in the foretoes, proceeding leads to regret. The Image says: Proceeding without victory brings misfortune. The text means: The foretoes are strong, but proceeding cannot undertake and leads to disaster. The Image means: Proceeding without being up to the task invites disaster. The initial nine represents the rising yang energy; in terms of the human body, it is like the toes. In terms of a person's ability, it signifies weaker capability, hence there is a concern of being ill-prepared to undertake tasks when moving forward. This is akin to a university student who excels in conduct and academics but, based solely on these merits, wishes to assume a leading position in an enterprise, yet clearly lacks sufficient capability."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: With trembling fear and proclaiming, at night there are enemies; do not worry.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: There are enemies; do not worry.

Even though danger is encountered, the outcome is \"do not worry.\"\n\nIn \"Xiang,\" this line is explained: \"There is conflict, but do not worry, because it is in accordance with the middle way.\" It points out: \"Calling out in alarm because there is warfare at night, but there is no danger, thus no need to worry.\" This is because the nine in the second line is in the central position of the lower trigram, able to adhere to the doctrine of the mean. Despite harassment from petty people or encounters with danger, it ultimately results in fright without incident, able to transform danger into safety.\n\nFor those who receive this line, they must remain vigilant constantly, preventing problems before they occur, as the presence of petty people may lead to unexpected situations in life when you are not paying attention. Therefore, maintaining vigilance and readiness is in accordance with the doctrine of the mean and is greatly beneficial.\n\nNine in the second line: Alert and calling out, there is warfare at dusk and night, do not worry.\n\nXiang says: There is conflict, but do not worry, it is in accordance with the middle way.\n\nThe meaning of the text is: Frightened and shouting out, there are soldiers passing by at night, there is no need to worry.\n\nThe meaning of the Xiang text is: Soldiers pass by at night, the nine in the second line is in accord with the principle of moderation, hence there is no need to worry.\n\nThe nine in the second line has a vigilant heart and maintains a moderate principle, so even if soldiers pass by at night, there is no need to worry. This is somewhat like the saying, \"one who has done no wrong in life is not startled by a knock at the door in the middle of the night.\" However, from the line text, it shows that nine in the second line is still startled by the passing soldiers.

However, as it ascends to the inner trigram of Qian (third, fourth, and fifth lines), the third line may not be fully expressed, leading to misfortune. Yet, when confronted with difficult situations, handling them alone may lead to intense anger, but ultimately no disaster occurs.\n\nIn \"Images,\" this line is analyzed as: \"The noble person forcefully goes about,” indicating no eventual blame. It suggests that if a noble person undertakes resolute and decisive actions alone, concealing emotions while dealing with mean people, it can prevent startling adversaries and unforeseen incidents, cutting off emotional entanglements and avoiding indecisiveness, thus avoiding disaster.\n\nThose who receive this line in divination should be mindful in speech and action, adopting more gentle methods and approaches.

Overusing this strength can achieve certain victories, but such extreme actions may also bring about opposite outcomes, making it difficult to completely eliminate opposing forces. Fortunately, the nine in the fifth position resides at the central place of the upper trigram and has an intimate relationship with the top line, thus possessing the virtues of firmness and the ability to act in moderation. By applying both kindness and authority to hostile forces, one can avoid disaster.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary explains this line: \"Walking in the middle without fault,\" the brightness does not yet shine. It points out: \"In behavior, it is advisable to follow the path of moderation, thereby reducing trouble.\" It indicates that despite holding an esteemed position where it might seem easy to deal with villains, one must not act excessively. Success lies in doing just enough to avoid disaster. It also suggests that adhering to the right path does not bring about great brilliance, only serves to prevent misfortune.\n\nThose who divinate this line may encounter obstacles or malicious individuals in work or life, and should deal with these calmly and avoid extremes.

It signifies the idea of burning wood to cook food, thus transforming the raw into the cooked, implying the removal of the old and the establishment of the new. The cauldron is a symbol of precious treasure and great vessel, representing stability with its three legs. Cooking food symbolizes abundance and the absence of hardship and trouble. On this foundation, it is suitable to implement reforms and develop one’s endeavors.\n\nThe Cauldron Hexagram follows the Revolution Hexagram, analyzed in the Sequence of Hexagrams: \"For transforming things, nothing surpasses the cauldron; hence it is followed by the cauldron.\" The most transformative object is the cauldron. In ancient times, it served as a cooking utensil, transforming raw meat to cooked food – the most thorough transformation. Therefore, following this, the discussion of the Cauldron Hexagram is fitting.\n\nThe cauldron not only serves as a cooking vessel but was also regarded in ancient times as a symbol of royal authority and a vessel for presenting talents to the ruler. The designs on the cauldron had the power to ward off evil, and sometimes legal inscriptions were engraved on them to display the solemnity of the law. When a dynasty changed, the first task for a newly enthroned ruler was to cast a new cauldron and promulgate laws as symbols of the new dynasty's commencement and to signify auspiciousness. The change of dynasty was also referred to as \"revolutionizing the cauldron.\" The Miscellaneous Hexagrams notes: \"Revolution is the removal of the old; the cauldron is the adoption of the new.\" It is evident that to truly discard the old and renew, revolution must precede the establishment of the cauldron.\n\nIn the Image, the analysis of this hexagram states: With wood above and fire, the cauldron, the noble person uses this metaphor to establish a position and fulfill his mission. This indicates: The hexagram image of the cauldron is Xun (wood) below and Li (fire) above, symbolizing fire burning above wood, which is a metaphor for cooking, hence called the cauldron. A noble person should be upright and steady like the cauldron to complete their mission.\n\nThe Cauldron Hexagram symbolizes eliminating the old and establishing the new and belongs to the lower-middle hexagrams.

When the balance of Yin and Yang is restored and the rain comes, regret and remorse are eliminated, ultimately leading to good fortune.\n\nIn 'The Image,' this line is explained as: \"The ears of the cauldron are damaged,\" losing its purpose. It points out here: \"The ear parts of the cauldron are damaged,\" rendering the cauldron immovable, thus losing its function of being open and accommodating.\n\nIn terms of the hexagram, Nine in the third position is at the top of the lower trigram. Though it is in the correct place, it is not central, which means its actions cannot uphold the doctrine of the mean. The highest leader of this hexagram, Six in the fifth position, is a Yin line in a Yang position, and it differs in nature from Nine in the third position, making it difficult to synchronize opinions and actions.

However, during a defeat, one must understand how to preserve strength and minimize losses.

These are reasons for launching an expedition, and by clarifying these reasons to the people, the campaign is justified, thus avoiding disaster.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line positioned at the ruler's place, situated in the middle but not upright. As a yin line at the ruler's position, it typically lacks the masculine vigor but possesses the virtue of gentleness and does not initiate aggression, advocating peace and justice, and treats subordinates with humility, respecting and promoting the worthy. In this hexagram, there are indeed invading enemies, so it is considered a just war. The officials staunchly support the fifth line, and the enthusiasm for combat is high. The key here is whether the fifth line can recognize and employ the right talents effectively.\n\nFor the commentary on the fifth line, the Image provides this explanation: \"The elder son leads the army,\" acting with moderation; \"the younger follows the coffin,\" leading to inappropriate use.

It has a correspondingly harmonious relationship with the fourth and fifth lines, suggesting it seeks to entertain and entice them into joy and pleasures. However, the fifth line holds a middle and just position, maintaining its stance without deviation, and the fourth line, due to being separated by the fifth, is not lured in.\n\nThe analysis in \"The Image\" goes: The top six \"luring joy,\" is not apparent. It indicates: The top six entices others to join in joy, but it is not a righteous and straightforward conduct; rather, it deviates from virtuous behavior, and this so-called joy could lead to danger.\n\nShould you receive this line in a reading, it implies a preoccupation with indulgences such as eating, drinking, and entertainment, attempting to draw in leaders and their aides to join in such delights.

If this is the case, you should examine your conduct, as this indulgence is not beneficial to you, and it is time to engage in some serious undertakings.\n\nFor those who received this line, it could mean having fondness for someone and a desire to express feelings to them, but unable to do so or being rejected.

The Image points out that the hexagram consists of Gen (mountain) below and Dui (marsh) above, representing the phenomenon of water nourishing the mountain below, while the mountain below supports and absorbs the moisture from the marsh above, symbolizing mutual responsiveness. It suggests that the gentleman emulates this connection between mountain and water by embracing others with an open-minded spirit.\n\nThe Xian Hexagram illustrates mutual attraction and influence, akin to a harmonious couple. Therefore, throughout history, scholars have often interpreted the Xian Hexagram as the hexagram of marriage, seeing it as the principle of enduring harmony in a couple. The Xian Hexagram consists of the Gen and Dui hexagrams stacked together, with Gen representing a young man and Dui a young woman. In the hexagram form, Dui is on top, like a gentle and affectionate young woman running ahead; while Gen as a mountain below resembles a strong young man chasing behind, creating a scene of mutual attraction and affection.

The meaning of this line is that the response occurs in the big toe.\n\nThe Hexagram Xián speaks of mutual response. As the initial stage of the hexagram, the response begins from the big toe on the foot. This signifies that two people have just made first contact. From the appearance of the hexagram, the Initial Six is a yin line situated in a yang position, which is improper in terms of placement, but it resonates with the Ninth in Fourth position, marking the beginning of yin-yang interaction. This kind of feeling is merely an initial impression and has not yet developed to the point of discussing marriage, nor does it involve fortune or misfortune.\n\nGetting this line in divination suggests that, at the initial meeting, the person feels goodwill from the other, and there is a desire to develop the relationship further, but the timing is not yet ripe, so it is not advisable to take initiative. At this moment, the response is the shallowest and insufficient to prompt action.\n\nInitial Six: Reach the big toe. The \"Image\" text states: Reaching the big toe indicates a desire to go outside.\n\nThe classic text means the response is felt in the big toe. The \"Image\" interpretation is that the response is felt in the significant place on the foot, with the mind inclined to move outward.\n\nThe line statements, according to the sequence from bottom to top, elucidate the characteristics of different stages of response. This response can be understood as interaction between a man and a woman, between heaven and earth, and between man and all things.\n\nHere, \"big toe\" refers to the big toe of a person’s foot. In the hexagram image, what responds to the Initial Six is the Fourth Nine line. \"Responsive in the big toe\" illustrates that the responsiveness of things goes through a stage from shallow to deep, and at this moment, it is at an elementary stage, so only a superficial response is possible.\n\nThere is an existence of spiritual sensing between people.

In terms of hexagram imagery, the six in the second position belongs to a yielding line in a soft position, which is correct. It corresponds correctly with the nine in the fifth position, indicating interaction between upper and lower. Seeking advancement is inherently good, but the six in the second position is centered in the lower hexagram and should maintain centrality as correct, only achieving good fortune through elevation by the nine in the fifth. Rashly pursuing advancement from a low position could result in multiple blows and obstruction, leading to misfortune.\n\nFor one who receives this line in a divination, if there is impatience and an attempt to proactively win the other's favor, the outcome may be counterproductive. It's important to recognize that your interactions and cooperation with others are still in the initial stages. Being overly eager and restless to achieve results makes reaching the goal difficult. It is best to remain calm and gradual, which will be auspicious.\n\nThe Comment on the Image says: \"Although there is misfortune, remaining still brings good fortune; compliance causes no harm.\" The text implies that influence reaching the calves results in danger, but staying in place is auspicious. The commentary suggests that though there is danger, staying within one's dwelling leads to good fortune, and compliance will not result in harm.\n\nThe interaction between the six in the second position and the nine in the fifth indicates that the influence has reached the calves, suggesting further development. However, the line states \"misfortune,\" why is this? The reason is that although the interaction between the second and the fifth has progressed to the calves, it has not reached a fervent level. Yet, the six in the second position wishes to rush and follow the nine in the fifth, but such actions will bring misfortune due to immaturity of timing. Thus, the line adds \"staying home brings good fortune,\" suggesting remaining indoors and not going out is auspicious. Why does the six in the second position imply going out? Because it is the lowest line in the inner hexagram Xun of the Influence hexagram, Xun symbolizes following, hence the implication of following others."},"line_3":{"description":"One feels drawn to the buttocks, holding on to what follows.

Holding to one's following brings regret.\n\nThe Image says: Influence shows itself in the thighs; it is not a restful position. The intention is to follow others, yet what it adheres to is base.\n\nThe text indicates: The influence moves into the thighs, desiring to act in concert with others but is restrained, resulting in trouble in proceeding. \n\nThe Image suggests: Influence shows itself in the thighs, which also implies an inability to remain settled. There is a desire to follow others, but it is restrained by a lower force.\n \nThe interaction of the third and the upper sixth line shows a stronger development than the previous two lines, as the influence has now reached the thighs. Due to being in the middle line of the lower trigram Xun, there's an indication of wanting to follow others.

The meaning of this line is: Good fortune can be attained, and difficulties and distress will disappear. Even if your mind is restless and your thoughts are constant, your friends will eventually align with your wishes. From the perspective of the hexagram imagery, the Nine in the fourth position is in the upper trigram, akin to the position of the heart in the human body, symbolizing a spiritual connection. Although the Nine is a yang line in a yin position and does not occupy its correct position, it is sincere and determined, with humility and respect downward. From the imagery of the hexagram, the Nine in the fourth position maintains interaction with the initial six. Despite not concerning itself with personal gain or loss, it keeps frequent interaction with the initial six, leading to an inevitable outcome of heart connecting with heart due to sincerity. For those who receive this line during divination, in terms of romantic relationships, it indicates that the connection with the other person has finally come into alignment, allowing you to take initiative, regardless of others' obstacles. As long as you engage frequently and sincerely, you are sure to affect the other person, leading them to become devoted to you. \"Integrity brings good fortune, remorse disappears, in a state of restless comings and goings, friends will follow your intentions.\" The text commentary states: \"Integrity brings good fortune, remorse disappears, as harm has not yet been felt.\" \"Restless comings and goings\" suggests a lack of clarity and openness. The line meanings describe the thoughts and feelings characteristic of those in a first love, capturing the anxiety of being discovered and the clandestine nature of such interactions. Although people are not as cautious in relationships today, that restless feeling remains. Interaction with such feelings shows that the connection has reached a mature stage, so as long as the relationship follows the path of integrity, there will be good fortune without regrets."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: Feeling in the back, no remorse.\n\nThe Image says: Feeling in the back signifies the end of intention.","interpretation":"Nine in the Fifth Place: Wounds on the back flesh, yet there is no calamity.  \nThe Commentary on the Symbol says: Raising his back, reacting as if carrying a heavy burden, it appears that his ambition is focused on humble matters.","scholar_interpretation":"Flat: For the one who obtains this line, human relations are not harmonious, and efforts result in minor achievements.

However, as a ruler of esteemed status, what he should be responsive to is the people of the entire world. \n\nThe \"Xiang\" (Symbolism) text analyzes this line: \"Feeling in the back\" signifies that the aspirations remain unrealized. It points out that the response occurs on the back, indicating a narrow focus on self-cultivation, and thereby suggests that his aspirations are inevitably shallow. \n\nAnyone who divines this line should carefully observe areas related to romantic relationships. If the partner shows no response to your desires, it may be due to their slow reaction or distraction.

The human back is rich in nerve pathways, hence extremely sensitive. However, above the fifth line is the ninth line.

The fourth nine appears as the object held inside the mouth, bitten by the upper and lower teeth, like being imprisoned, unable to escape, thus symbolizing a prison.\n\nFrom the perspective of a prison, the first and top nine resemble solid prison walls.

The former kings used this to clearly define punishment and proper laws.\n\n\"The Image\" points out that the hexagram's imagery is Zhen (thunder) below and Li (fire) above, representing the phenomenon of lightning striking. Lightning striking is similar to biting; thunder has deterrent power, and lightning can illuminate. Ancient emperors emulated this phenomenon to make their punishments clear and laws correct.\n\nThe Shihe hexagram reveals the principle of combining firmness with gentleness and is considered a very auspicious hexagram. \"The Image\" commentates on Shihe as: When fortunes are poor, it's akin to being hungry; fortunately, food is delivered, satisfying the mouth and stomach, joy arises, and worries gradually fade away.\n\nFrom the hexagram image analysis, the upper trigram of Shihe is Li, representing fire and electricity, and the lower trigram is Zhen, representing wood and thunder. Lightning and thunder collide, striking objects and burning them, representing the imagery of Shihe. During a thunderstorm, buildings struck by lightning may collapse, animals and people hit may die, and forests hit may catch fire.

Explanation of the line statement.\n\nFlesh: refers to the meat attached to the skin.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: biting into fat meat, the nose is buried, without disaster. The text means: biting into meat, the nose gets buried in it. The Second Six, holding the position of a noble, is too greedy while eating meat, causing the nose to sink into it. Eating like this certainly appears improper. However, it's just a matter of appearance, without significant faults, so there is no disaster. Since the Second Six is above the First Nine, it has the imagery of overpowering strength. Generally speaking, when the passive overpowers the active, it implies a usurpation of authority, such as a woman seizing control from a man. The Second Six is favorably positioned and remains central, indicating moral alignment. However, as it rides above the First Nine, the line describes the gluttony of \"eating meat,\" which actually hints at the Second Six's greed towards the First Nine, meaning that the Second Six is too eager to control the First Nine.\n\nFrom the hexagram imagery, the Second Six is within the mutual Gen. Gen represents the interrelation between the Second Six and the Fourth Nine as the Gen hexagram. The Gen hexagram has one yang line outside and two yin lines inside. The yang line is the outer skin, and the yin lines are the fat underneath the skin. Gen also symbolizes the nose, representing snouted animals. Flesh refers to skin-covered meat, soft meat, fresh meat. So, when biting, the nose gets trapped. If a person eats like this, their eating manner is careless and inelegant, indicating that people are indiscriminate and neglectful in their actions.\n\nThe Second Six line, being a yin line in a soft position, although correctly positioned in the center, is reciprocally opposed to the ruler line, Fifth Six, within the hexagram. Being in discord with the highest authority in the hexagram will lead to unfavorable self-development, harboring resentment internally, causing negligence in action. However, since it overrides the First Nine, like an enforcer of punishment, there is no disaster.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination: you might feel dissatisfied with your job or position, feeling unsmooth, and sometimes losing your temper. Pay attention to your manner of speech and actions, avoiding severe punishment or harsh scolding when someone around makes a mistake, and refrain from ranting angrily, as this damages your image without being effective in teaching. Remember that criticism is an art; sometimes when you wish to rebuke someone, considering the outcome, it's better to offer advice.

Here, it metaphorically indicates that the difficulty of the matter has increased.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: Biting into dried meat, encountered a poisoned part. There is slight trouble, but no misfortune. The text means: Bite into dried meat, and yet it is poisoned, there is a little bit of misfortune, but no disaster. The six in the third line is a soft line occupying an odd position, which means it is out of place and does not fit the center. It happens to be the lower line of the Kan trigram, the inner trigram of the Shi He hexagram. Kan signifies poison, thus the imagery of \"encountering poison.\" However, the six in the third line is also the central line of the inner Gen trigram, which halts when encountering danger. Thus, the poisoning is not deep, and there will be no major disaster, just some minor troubles. In modern terms, if you eat moldy dried meat and notice the off taste early, you stop eating further, so it won't harm your body.\n\nThe warning of this line is: Pursuing material gains is like biting into poisonous dried meat; it is dangerous. However, being cautious in your endeavors is still possible.\n\nAlthough the six in the third is within the Gen trigram, it is closer to the upper trigram, Li, compared to the six in the second. Li represents fire, and meat dried under such conditions becomes dried meat. Simultaneously, the group of six in the third, nine in the fourth, and six in the fifth compose the Kan trigram; Kan signifies poison, representing the danger of pursuing material gains realistically.\n\nThe six in the third is a yin line occupying a strong position, inherently inappropriate. It is likened to someone who does not have the authority to enforce penalties yet does so to others. In implementation, it is as difficult as chewing tough dried meat, provoking reactions of resentment and poison.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, they might encounter insurmountable difficulties at work, so they should be cautious to avoid harm.

Explanation of the line text: \n\n\"Dry meat with bones\" refers to dried meat that includes bones. \"Metal arrowhead\" refers to an arrowhead made of metal. \n\nThe meaning of this line is: Biting through dry meat with bones results in obtaining a metal arrowhead. It is advantageous to maintain the right path amid difficulties, leading to auspicious results. The text means: Eating dry meat on bones, and finding a copper arrowhead, it is beneficial to uphold the right path amid difficulties, and it is propitious. The image suggests that maintaining the right path amid difficulties is due to not having reached a bright stage. \n\nIn the context of Shi He hexagram, the fourth line corresponds to something hard being bitten on, akin to a bone, hence the text specifically refers to dry meat on the bone. From the perspective of the hexagram, the fourth line being a yang line in a soft position implies traits of resilience and vigor, as well as humility and compliance, representing a balance of firmness and softness. The fourth line represents a high official close to the ruler, whose position is represented by six in the fifth, a yin line. This ruler is inherently soft and weak, heavily relying on the fourth line, which must take on major responsibilities, the \"hard bones,\" of governance. \n\nSituated within the inner Kan (six-three, nine-four, six-five), Kan represents difficulties and obstacles. The fourth line must rely on steadfast adherence to the right path to overcome challenges. Although difficult, there will be unexpected rewards. In ancient times, meat came from hunted animals, and it's possible that metal arrowheads remained on them after the hunt. The fourth line's unexpected reward is compared to finding a metal arrowhead while eating meat. \n\nThis line provides the insight that, in challenging circumstances, if you maintain an upright heart and strong will, and strive hard to overcome difficulties, despite this \"dried meat with bones\" being tough to chew, persistence and perseverance will lead to some gain. In ancient times, people often ate the game from hunting, so finding an arrowhead in the meat was common. However, here it indicates an unexpected gain.

As long as one adheres to the right path, though there is danger, misfortune is avoided. The symbolic meaning is: Adhering to the right path results in no misfortune because the position of six in the fifth place is appropriate.\n\nEven the emperor, the revered Nine in the fifth place, eats dried meat, indicating the ability to practice thriftiness along with the subjects of the realm. Living in such simplicity naturally enriches the national treasury, hence \"acquiring gold.\" By not consuming fresh meat and opting for dried meat, it reflects frugality. Why is this said? Because in ancient times, fresh meat was considered a delicacy; typically, after capturing prey, it would be cooked and eaten immediately. However, as more game was caught than could be consumed, surplus meat remained. Some of this meat rotted, while some were dried by the wind and still edible. Gradually, people mastered the technique of preserving fresh meat. When a ruler leads by example with frugal consumption, it naturally influences the populace to also become frugal. In this way, social wealth can accumulate. This is, in fact, a highly important governance strategy in times of prosperity.\n\nLine statement: Six in the fifth place: Biting into dried meat, one acquires gold; perseverance brings danger, yet no misfortune. Life insight:\n\nFrom the hexagram, six in the fifth place, being a yielding line occupying a firm position, harmonizes yin and yang. Also, it resides in the central position, able to uphold the middle path. The challenges it faces are more significant, as it deals not with \"fat meat\" or \"cured meat\" but \"dried meat.\" In such a circumstance, six in the fifth place can adhere to the right path, overcome difficulties, and resolutely remove villany, thereby earning the trust of others. Six in the fifth place often harbors a sense of vigilance, preventing issues before they arise, thus naturally reducing calamities and gaining unexpected rewards. Those who receive this line in divination should emulate the spirit of Nine in the fifth place; though facing peril and obstruction, one can still traverse smoothly."},"line_6":{"description":"Top nine.

Exegesis of the line statement:\n\nHe: Means \"carry,\" implying to bear a burden. Jiao: Wooden restraints, referring to constraints. Mie: Refers to covering or obscuring.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: bearing a heavy yoke that covers the ears, which is dangerous.\n\nThe scripture implies: wearing a yoke that covers the ears is dangerous.\n\nThe top nine bears a heavy yoke on his shoulder for everyone to see, serving as a warning to others not to commit crimes like this person. Only serious offenders wear yokes; the main purpose is to warn posterity, not to reform the offender, because such offenders are usually executed after being displayed. Hence, it is dangerous. How did this top nine end up like this? The explanatory text provides the answer: \"He is not wise.\" It means that this person lacks perceptiveness, leading to this outcome. Why is he not perceptive? Because he fails to see the current situation. The current situation deals with punishing evil deeds, rewarding good deeds, yet he continues to indulge in evil activities, leading to greater offenses and his present predicament. Although he has ears, they are of no great use. His stubborn unwillingness to change ultimately led to serious crimes, resulting in his being yoked, paraded in public, and executed as an example to remind the populace to abide by the law.\n\nTop nine: Carrying the punishment with ears covered, ominous. Life Lesson:\n\nThe Explanation says: \"Carrying the punishment with ears covered,\" means lacking awareness.\n\nThis highlights why from the initial nine of \"being restrained\" to \"carrying the punishment,\" with the restraint moving from the feet to the shoulders, the severity has reached its peak. It is because of not heeding advice, unable to reform and do good, being too unwise, leading to severe punishment.\n\nFrom the hexagram imagery, the top nine is at the end position of the Li hexagram and on top of the middle Kan (six three, nine four, six five), with Li representing the eyes and Kan representing the ears, showing the obscuring of sight and hearing. Due to one's lack of wisdom and heedlessness of advice, the restraint ends up on the shoulders.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, if while doing something, a friend advises you, but you fail to heed your friend's sincere counsel and stubbornly proceed in an uncertain venture, you will quickly find yourself in a difficult situation both internally and externally."}},"46":{"general":{"description":"Ascension.

Xun represents wind, and it is positioned below. Kun represents earth, and it is positioned above. Wind, when trapped underground, cannot fully exert its power; it is only when it rises from below the ground to above it that it can demonstrate its true strength.\n\nWind beneath the ground is akin to a talented person who goes unnoticed among the masses, requiring elevation to unleash their potential. From this perspective, the meaning of Sheng implies the promotion of talented individuals to their rightful positions.\n\nKun symbolizes the earth and obedience; Xun symbolizes wood and modesty. The earth nurtures trees, which gradually grow, becoming taller and substantial, analogously signifying a progressive advancement in one's career and a bright future, hence the name \"Sheng\" (rising).\n\nThe Sheng Hexagram follows the Cui Hexagram, explained in the Sequence of Hexagrams as: \"When gatherings ascend, they are said to rise, hence Shen follows Cui.\" After gathering, developing upwards is advancement, leading to Sheng Hexagram appearing subsequently.\n\nIn the Image, Sheng Hexagram is described as: \"Wood grows within the earth, representing ascent; the noble person uses this to cultivate virtue in harmony, accumulating small advancements to build greatness.\" Herein it indicates: the image of the Sheng Hexagram has Xun (wind) below and Kun (earth) above, with Xun further symbolizing large trees, thus an image of trees growing from the earth. The progression from small to large trees symbolizes ascension. Correspondingly, the noble person follows natural laws to cultivate virtues, gradually making small progress to create an outstanding persona.\n\nThe Sheng Hexagram symbolizes gentleness and humility, representing upward movement, and is considered highly auspicious.

Explanation of the Yao text: The dragon appears in the field, which is advantageous for meeting a great person to further one's development.\n\n\"Seeing\" here has two interpretations: one means \"appearing,\" and the other means \"meeting.\"\n\nThe meaning of this Yao text is: The dragon appears in the field, making it favorable to meet a great individual. \n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the nine in the second place is a yang line occupying a yin position, representing a loss of position, yet it is centrally located in the lower trigram. Two being on the earth signifies the dragon has already shown its talents and gained attention. Meeting a great person at this time is advantageous. Although there is a certain level of capability, it is still limited; encountering a great individual offers further honing and nurturing. Additionally, being supported by a great person will lead to smoother progress. This great person is your benefactor. The most classic example is Shun's experience; during his farming and fishing days, due to his outstanding performance, he was appreciated by Yao. Shun exemplifies the concept of \"benefiting from meeting a great person.\"\n\nConsidering a person's life, this stage corresponds to around twenty-five to thirty-five years old, indicating a period after learning and accumulating experiences, possessing certain abilities, and being ready to show one's talents and abilities. At this juncture, assistance from a benefactor is even more beneficial for achieving success."},"line_3":{"description":"The superior person appears busy and vigilant all day long, alert as if constantly facing danger; there will be no blame.\n\nThe Image says: Constantly busy throughout the day suggests the persistence of one's path.","interpretation":"A virtuous gentleman is diligent and industrious during the day, and cautious and self-reflective at night.

By doing so, while danger may be present, it will not lead to calamity.\n\nThe Nine in the Third Line is a yang yao, also known as a strong line. In the I Ching, yang lines are associated with gentlemen, and yin lines with lesser people. The \"Appended Phrases\" states: \"The second line gains much praise, the fourth much fear; the third, great misfortune; the fifth, great achievements.\" This yao is also situated in the realm of \"great misfortune.\" In the \"Commentary on the Words,\" this yao is explained as: The third line itself is excessively firm and acts without moderation, resulting in a state of being neither above in heaven nor below on earth, thus requiring a spirit of perseverance and constant vigilance in response to changing circumstances. By doing this, even when encountering danger, calamity can be avoided.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the nine in the third line is located in the lower trigram, and the progress of the next step is unclear. Only by embodying the spirit of the Qian hexagram, advancing day and night, can success be achieved. Though the development from the first and second lines suggests a rising trend of yang energy, from \"the dragon lying low, do not use\" to \"the dragon appearing in the field,\" indicating a gradual ascent, the situation's development is not always so straightforward, and success is not always smooth. Nevertheless, by maintaining diligence and vigilance, even if there is danger, calamity can be averted.\n\nThe \"Images\" explain this yao as: \"Toil all day long,\" repeating the Dao. It highlights that \"constant self-improvement\" is necessary to avoid relapse and ensure no negligence.\n\nThe position of \"Nine in the Third Line\" is at the end of the lower trigram, and within the Qian hexagram, given the trend from the first two trigrams, it is at a stage where yang energy is rising. Yet, due to its position in the lower trigram, the future remains uncertain. Thus, a mindset of diligence and alertness is required, akin to a psychological stage that must be experienced by those striving for achievements in their endeavors.\n\nThis phase resembles that of freshly graduated students who, confident in their achievements, face an unpredictable world. The challenges encountered in society far exceed the simple imaginings of school life, revealing numerous unforeseen difficulties.\n\nFrom a life perspective, the period represented by this yao should be around thirty-five to forty-five years of age. In this phase, one's career is at a midpoint, fraught with maximum pressure. During this period, persistence must be maintained to achieve success; otherwise, there is a risk of failing midway."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the Fourth Place: One may leap into the abyss, no blame.  \nThe Image says: One may leap into the abyss, there is no fault in advancing.","interpretation":"Nine in the fourth position: The dragon may leap into the deep abyss, there is no misfortune.  \nThe commentary says: The dragon may leap into the deep abyss, indicating that it can achieve something without misfortune.","scholar_interpretation":"Flat: Those who receive this line will find everything difficult.

Life's Enlightenment\n\nThe enlightenment this line offers is: advance or retreat based on reason.\n\nFrom the hexagram's image, the Nine in the Fourth begins to enter the upper hexagram. It belongs to a yang line situated in a soft position, which is a misplaced position, thus appearing unstable. Therefore, the hexagram text includes the word \"whether,\" indicating uncertainty. However, this uncertainty of whether to rise or submerge is correct as it changes according to the situation and time, eliminating faults.\n\nIn the Qian Hexagram, the previous lines refer to the dragon needing to hold back and improve. By the fourth line, it enters the upper hexagram. The \"dragon\" subjectively feels its strength is sufficiently accumulated and thus becomes eager to test its abilities. However, because the situation is not entirely favorable, as the nine in the fourth line exists during a period of fluctuating and ascending yang energy, the yang energy is not yet strong enough to overcome the yin. Therefore, although the nine in the fourth line is eager to act, it must handle the situation well, advancing when appropriate and retreating when necessary."},"line_5":{"description":"In the fifth place: The flying dragon is in the sky; it is beneficial to see the great man.  \nThe Image says: The flying dragon is in the sky; it acts in accordance with the great man.","interpretation":"Nine in the fifth position: The dragon soars in the sky, advantageous for meeting noble and aristocratic figures.  \nAs the commentary says: The dragon soaring in the sky signifies that the gentleman has great achievements to accomplish.","scholar_interpretation":"Auspicious: Those who obtain this line will encounter noble people, and their plans will succeed.

The yang energy symbolized by the dragon, after struggling against the yin energy, finally soars into the sky, shining like the noonday sun and illuminating the earth, with all things bathed in warm sunlight. Good fortune is now at its peak. In the commentary, this line is explained as: \"Flying dragon in the sky,\" referring to the actions of a great man. It indicates that a dragon soaring in the sky symbolizes that a person of great virtue and influence will certainly achieve significant accomplishments.\n\nIn terms of personal development, this line, the Nine in the Fifth Place, is akin to a talented individual who, after great effort, finally embraces the opportunity for grand achievements.

When things reach their extreme, they inevitably reverse; when yang is at its extreme, it declines, like the sun at noon starting to set, unable to last long.\n\nIn the \"Commentary on the Words,\" it says: \"The meaning of 'excessive' is to know how to advance but not to retreat, to know how to survive but not to perish, to know how to gain but not to lose; is it only the sage who comprehends all this?

From the hexagram's image, Gen represents the mountain, which is firm and positioned above. Xun represents the wind, which is gentle and positioned below. This is akin to a sturdy, tall house built on a soft foundation, making it extremely dangerous, as it might collapse at any moment. Gen as a mountain implies the meaning of stopping, while Xun as wind implies submission. When the upper halts and the lower submits, things are bound to cease development, resulting in a poor outcome.\n\nIn this hexagram, \"Gu\" represents an event, namely \"something has happened\" or \"trouble is arising.\" Here, it uses decay to metaphorize human affairs, indicating a time of changing fortunes and also a moment for heroes to take action, advocating for a spirit of self-renewal in response.\n\nBesides revealing that people will encounter trouble, the Gu hexagram also tells people how to resolve these troubles—through self-renewal, self-reflection, and self-examination. By doing so, one can reduce the occurrence of troubles and nip them in the bud.\n\nThe Gu hexagram follows the Sui hexagram, and the \"Sequence of the Hexagrams\" states: \"Those who follow joyfully must encounter matters, hence it is followed by Gu.\" Here it succeeds the Yu hexagram and the Sui hexagram, which means that following others with delight can lead to certain disadvantages that need correction and rectification.\n\nThe \"Image\" says: \"The wind beneath the mountain, Gu; the gentleman uses it to stir people and cultivate virtue.\" The \"Image\" interprets the hexagram of Gu, suggesting Xun (wind) beneath Gen (mountain), creating the image of a strong wind rising underneath a mountain, symbolizing the rectification of corruption and disorder. At this time, the gentleman helps the people, fosters virtue, and rectifies contemporary issues.\n\nThe Gu hexagram reveals the principle of revitalizing the weak and reversing decline, belonging to a moderate hexagram. The \"Image\" further breaks down this hexagram: within its line images, like grinding, it is favorable when the course is smooth but disastrous when reversed; beneficial intentions persist, but delays lead to errors emerging from busy situations.\n\nThe Gu hexagram's diagram consists of three yin lines and three yang lines.

This could involve dealing with bad traditions or customs, a multitude of unresolved issues, or numerous debts left behind. Patience and personal abilities are needed to resolve these issues. Although troublesome, it also provides an opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities. Whether you are a capable successor and can perform in this position will be proven by how you address these challenges.\n\nAlternatively, it might mean that your ancestors left behind many problems or unfulfilled goals that you must address according to their original intentions.\n\nThis suggests that a son who inherits the family estate should correct the flaws left by the father. Only by doing so can he preserve the family estate, ensuring stability for the deceased father in the afterlife, hence \"no blame for the father.\" If the son does not take these actions, the family estate cannot be sustained, and there's a risk of extinguishing the family's lineage, which would naturally bring misfortune to the father lying in the grave. Correcting the problems will bring benefits, so despite any dangers, it is necessary to correct them because, in the end, it will lead to auspiciousness. This is akin to Emperor Wu of Han, who \"solely revered Confucianism and abolished other schools,\" changing Empress Dowager Dou's governance methods, and Emperor Jiaqing executing the corrupt official Heshen and altering the political landscape of the Qianlong period.

However, regarding these problems, one should not hastily express affirmative or negative opinions. Patience is crucial; first observe, think, and uphold the right path, taking action only when the time is ripe.\n\nNine in the second place corresponds with six in the fifth place. The fifth line of the Tai Hexagram is the middle line of the Kun Mother, and when it transforms into Gu, the Kun Image is hidden, thus representing a deceased mother. In a patriarchal society, women did not participate in politics, so the \"corruption of the mother\" refers to favoritism, indulgence, and those faults within the private chambers that cannot be too strictly corrected. Maternal issues are family issues, while paternal issues are social issues; there is a difference in importance. Excessively correcting the mother's faults may damage filial piety and does not greatly contribute to governing the state."},"line_3":{"description":"To manage the decay initiated by the father brings small regret, but no great fault.

This suggests that in resolving problems, one may offend the elders or forebears.\n\nFor a child or junior, if the father has issues or has left behind numerous troubles, in the process of correction or saving, it's inevitable to offend the father's dignity or face, making them feel embarrassed, or they may be unwilling to change and have opinions against the child. As a child, you will certainly have some remorse, but since your actions are righteous and in line with the right path, there will be no substantial harm.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it may indicate taking up a new position and needing to deal with issues left by previous occupants. During this process, attention should be paid to one's attitude and methods. If the accumulated issues are deeply ingrained, one should act according to circumstances, proceed step-by-step, gradually replacing the old order with a more suitable one. Although difficulties and perils will be encountered, since the nine in the third is in a yang position and has obtained a rightful place, there will not be significant harm.\n\nThe nine in the third position is at the outermost of the lower trigram, often resulting in extreme actions. Correcting the father’s mistakes is appropriate but should not be overdone; if it is overly excessive, it may lead to regretful events. However, it cannot be left uncorrected, as doing so will be beneficial for future development, and thus there will be no great disaster, ultimately leading to a good outcome.\n\n\"Nine in the third\" has no corresponding line above, correcting the disruptions of the forebears leads to slight regret.

The meaning of this line is: being lenient and indulgent towards the malpractices of the predecessors will inevitably lead to regret in the future.\n\nWhen analyzing the lines of the I Ching, the characteristic of the fourth line is fear—fear because it is close to the Nine in the fifth place, near the ruler, thus filled with apprehension and unable to progress. It bears the influence of yang and yin, causing nervous tension. This characteristic is fully reflected in the Six in the fourth place of this hexagram. Being a yin line in a gentle position, it has an excess of softness and a deficiency of firmness. In practice, this results in hesitation and caution, lacking the resolve to thoroughly address the entrenched fallacies left by previous generations. This indecisiveness and contentment with the status quo without seeking advancement will lead to regretful situations.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, it suggests that they might have arrived at a new position. Although they discover many faults left by predecessors, in their actions, they worry about offending their predecessors and fear the discontent of subordinates, thus turning a blind eye. When making corrections, they do so perfunctorily. Such an approach fails to rectify ingrained bad habits and instead fosters the spread of an unhealthy atmosphere, ultimately leading to perilous consequences.\n\nThe Six in the fourth place does not initiate \"correcting the father's corruption\" but tolerates the father's mistakes to continue. Such practice is not advisable, as it will lead to troublesome affairs if this continues. For example, when Emperor Qianlong abdicated in favor of Emperor Jiaqing, he still held all significant authority. Emperor Jiaqing could only \"indulge the father's corruption.\" According to historical records, in court, Qianlong would sit to the right of Jiaqing. When Qianlong laughed heartily, Jiaqing could only follow with an awkward laugh. When Qianlong was angry, Jiaqing was at a loss.

The reason why \"rescuing the decayed foundation of the father will surely win the praise of the people\" is because inheriting the legacy of the father with virtue is always welcomed. This is a matter of approach and method.\n\nThroughout the Gu Hexagram, it can be seen that the same \"correcting the father's decay,\" if treated in the third line, is too forceful and rigid in method, while the fourth line is excessively weak, fearing both front and back. These approaches deviate from the Doctrine of the Mean, either being too strong or too weak, failing to achieve a balance of firmness and gentleness. The fifth line, being a yin line in a yang position, successfully balances firmness and gentleness, holding the honored central position, utilizing virtue instead of force, resulting in praise.\n\nThose who draw this line, if looking to rectify a business or reform an old system, should adopt methods that align with the middle way, balancing firmness and gentleness, promoting virtue rather than relying solely on strong measures. Only in this way can they receive unanimous praise.\n\nThe holder of the fifth line, in the position of a ruler, uses gentle virtues to correct the flaws left by the father, advocating for people to take pride in diligence, integrity, benevolence, and clean governance. They highly praise those who are diligent, frugal, honest, and selflessly serve the public, which undoubtedly enhances the construction of spiritual civilization effectively. For example, in the early days of the foundation of New China, Chairman Mao advocated for people to be diligent, frugal, honest, selflessly contribute, and fearlessly sacrifice, resulting in a great improvement in social ethos. People admired those with high moral standards rather than those who were wealthy and powerful, thus checking and countering the influence of the unfair and promoting the path of justice.

Esteeming one's own affairs implies that one sees their actions as noble.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: One does not seek careers with kings and lords, viewing such behavior as noble.\n\nThe Image says: \"Not serving kings and lords\" indicates an intention that can be emulated. This phrase means: \"Not serving kings and lords,\" this noble aspiration, can serve as a principle for people to learn from.\n\nThe Top Nine position is the final line of the Gu hexagram, indicating an end to the rectification of corruption, thus retiring after achieving success, no longer seeking rank and title from kings and lords. This conduct is noble and worthy of emulation. Since ancient times, there have been countless instances of \"when cunning hares die, fine hounds are cooked.\"\n\nThose who draw this line should be mindful of understanding the situation appropriately, avoiding seeking credit or rewards from leaders, and not striving for honors and positions. Act when needed, retreat and hide when not; remain pure and return to seclusion. They should not rely on others for support nor depend on them. Abide by their own development needs, dedicating themselves wholeheartedly to their own undertakings.\n\nTop Nine occupies the highest position of the Gu hexagram, at the peak of Gu. This means that the decadent and corrupt customs of society have already reached their extremity. What then should a gentleman do in such circumstances? Should they conform to the corrupt ways, or oppose them? But since \"Gu\" has developed into an overwhelming trend, opposing it is akin to trying to crush a stone with an egg, which would lead to one's destruction. Such actions would result in even fewer decent individuals in society. So what should be done? Therefore, one can only \"not serve kings and lords, esteem one's own affairs.\" This means not taking government positions, leaving decadent and corrupt environments, and seeking seclusion for preservation. In other words, becoming a hermit. However, this does not mean withdrawing from the world and ignoring external matters altogether after retreating. Rather, one should pursue what they consider noble actions and, if within their capacity, continue doing such things.\n\nIn terms of the hexagram image, the upper nuclear trigram of the Gu hexagram represents Zhen, which represents kings and lords, while Top Nine is outside Zhen, thus creating the hexagram image of \"not serving kings and lords.\""}},"42":{"general":{"description":"Increase.

It signifies decreasing above to increase below, whereas the latter signifies decreasing below to increase above.

Hence, even in danger, one will receive help from others.","philosophy":"The hexagram Yi represents the symbolism of Wind and Thunder in the I Ching. The Yi hexagram is composed of two different trigrams: Zhen below and Xun above. Xun symbolizes wind, while Zhen symbolizes thunder. When the thunder roars, it shakes the wind above it. The wind then rises, benefiting all things on the ground. The wind often blows things from above, implying that benefit comes from above to below.\n\nFrom another perspective, when the thunder roars and stirs the wind, the strong wind carries the thunder's sound far away. As wind and thunder interact, their force grows stronger, the thunder sounds louder, and they assist and enhance each other. This is akin to a superior providing benefits to subordinates, which in turn causes the subordinates to support the superior more, resulting in mutual benefit.\n\nThe Yi hexagram follows the Sun hexagram. In the \"Sequence of Hexagrams,\" it is explained: \"After a continual process of reduction, there inevitably comes an increase; thus, it follows with Yi.\" Continuous reduction is eventually followed by increase. The Yi and Sun hexagrams have a complementary relationship, indicating that now is the time to reduce from above to enrich below.\n\nThe \"Image\" section analyzes the Yi hexagram: \"Wind and thunder represent Yi; the junzi observes goodness and emulates it, and corrects any errors.\" It highlights that the Yi hexagram is Zhen below Xun above, representing \"Wind and Thunder Increase.\" When the wind blows, thunder amplifies its power; when thunder strikes, strong wind enhances its momentum. The interaction and mutual enhancement of gale and thunder showcase the concept of \"increase,\" symbolizing growth. A junzi should learn from this to adopt the strengths of others, enhance their virtue, emulate good behavior immediately, and correct mistakes promptly, continually strengthening their noble character.\n\nThe Yi hexagram, symbolizing increase, is regarded as extremely auspicious.

Interpretation of the line’s words: \"Undertake\" refers to taking action. The meaning of this line is: It is advantageous for great undertakings, starting with great auspiciousness, without disaster. From the hexagram's image, the Initial Nine is a yang line located in a firm position, properly placed. Although it is at the bottom of the Yi hexagram, since the Yi hexagram benefits the lower and lessens the upper, it allows for substantial achievements. \n\nThe \"Image\" explains this line as: \"Fundamentally auspicious, without trouble,\" is not overburdened with service. It points out: \"Beneficial to undertake great works, starting with great auspiciousness, without disaster,\" because the lower position does not need to exert all efforts in serving the upper position. For those who obtain this line, it implies that the long-awaited opportunity has arrived, and one should seize the chance. Although there may be some risks, the final result is very promising. The task to be done is to strive for the support of superiors, but at this time, there is no need to petition superiors, as they will proactively come to help. \n\nHowever, the undertaking has this latent issue: if things go well, the credit may belong to the superiors; if it fails, you might bear the primary responsibility. Thus, for such matters, one must be cautious and diligent, ultimately achieving success and gaining considerable attention and recognition from superiors, receiving special commendation. \n\nInitial Nine: Beneficial to undertake great works, fundamentally auspicious, without trouble. The Image says: Fundamentally auspicious, without trouble, because the lower does not bear heavy service. The text means: Beneficial to develop great enterprises, greatly auspicious, without disaster. The Image commentary means: Greatly auspicious with no disaster because the people below are not subjected to heavy exploitation. \n\nInitial Nine is located at the bottom of the Yi hexagram, and since the Yi hexagram benefits the lower and diminishes the upper, Initial Nine is also the greatest beneficiary. When the ruler allows the people to benefit, how could the people not be auspicious and free of disaster? Therefore, in this favorable situation, people should make great efforts to actively develop the economy. Because the ruler no longer heavily exploits the people, most of their labor earnings are their own.

This sentence means that the opposing side can offer a divine tortoise worth ten pairs.

If the king offers sacrifices to the celestial deity and prays for blessings and protection at this time, he will also fulfill his wish and receive prosperity.\n\nThe Commentary explains this line as follows: \"Someone increases it\" comes from outside. It indicates that \"someone brings a divine tortoise worth ten pairs,\" which is a great good fortune not obtained through greed or active seeking, but as an unexpected gain willingly delivered by others.\n\nThose who draw this line may encounter unexpected financial luck. You should neither abandon nor miss this opportunity but seize it boldly and strive.

This indicates that using the advantages gained to rescue others from their crises is the best way to protect oneself. Being in a prominent position brings many benefits, but it also lays the ground for potential troubles. To gain people's favor and avoid disasters, one must use these benefits to help others, thereby securing what one has obtained.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram line in a divination, it is important to understand the principles of gain and loss. When financial resources are abundant, one should extend a helping hand to those in need, using one's surplus to relieve those in distress. When acting, one must be sincere, uphold integrity, and proceed cautiously. Always maintain an attitude of reverent humility, like ancient ministers holding a jade tablet reporting to their lord, establishing a positive public image. This helps safeguard one's wealth and reduce complications.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram line, some troubles might arise that require spending money to resolve. When managing affairs, take the middle path, neither veering left nor right. Promptly report the situation to superiors or legal authorities.

There is sincerity in moderation; inform the duke with the jade tablet.\"\n\nThe imagery says: Using what is gained in times of disaster consolidates one's inherent interests.\n\nThis position is one of a prince or king, allowing him to receive many gifts, although these gifts are not from the disaster area. Using the received wealth to aid the disaster-stricken is an unselfish act, thus no disaster befalls him. The \"jade tablet\" serves as a credential for disaster relief. \"The Rituals of Zhou\" records: \"The precious jade tablet is used for summoning defenders and aiding in times of calamity.\" This \"jade tablet\" is a token granted by the emperor to his vassals. When a vassal state suffers from disasters or invasions and seeks assistance from the emperor, this jade serves as the token. The third line, being royal, possesses this token. Thus, he sends envoys to use it to request aid from the emperor to relieve the distressed populace."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine at the fourth place: Walk in the center; announce public compliance.

It is beneficial to rely on transferring the state.\" Explanation: This line demonstrates the characteristic of adhering to the middle path. Its correct counterpart is the initial nine, which is in the lower hexagram Zhen. Zhen represents vassal lords and is called a duke; Line Four is in the upper hexagram Xun, which signifies following. Together, it forms \"inform the lord and follow him,\" meaning to inform the lord and follow.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" explains this line as \"inform the lord and follow, to benefit the aspirations.\" Here it points out: \"If there are matters to report to the lord, the lord would be very willing to agree,\" not for any other reason, but because the aspiration to willingly self-diminish for the benefit of the people has moved the lord or noble.\n\nFor those who draw this line, when deciding to make significant changes, such as altering investment strategies or directions, one should first seek the consent of superiors and colleagues. Your career may have hit a bottleneck locally, and you're in a difficult spot. You wish to relocate your business elsewhere or even abroad, which requires the consent and assistance of your superiors. If you want to change careers or jobs, you should discuss it with your family to ensure your plans proceed smoothly.\n\nLine Four: Walking mediating, informing the lord, and following him.

It is beneficial to affiliate with a powerful nation for relocating the capital.\n\nThe image says informing the lord's followers to enhance the collective will.\n\nLine Four is the upper line of the lower overlapping trigram Kun, and the middle line of the upper overlapping trigram Gen, while also being the lower line of the upper trigram in Yi Hexagram, adjacent to the lower trigram Zhen. Considering all these hexagram images, it can be seen that the position of Line Four is in a disaster-prone area, plagued by constant droughts and floods. How to deal with this poor environment? The only solution is to relocate the capital. Moving the national capital closer to the capital of the Son of Heaven's domain provides a quick means of seeking aid if the nation encounters natural disasters.

Rewarding my virtue: means repaying my kindness. The meaning of this line is: With a heart full of sincerity and benevolence, there is no need to ask; great fortune is obvious, and people will certainly repay my virtue of benevolence with kindness. In the Yi Hexagram, the Nine in the Fifth position holds the central and correct position, and corresponds correctly with the Six in the Second, intending to bring benefits to the people. The Nine in the Fifth is at the top position of the Li Hexagram, Li representing the turtle, which can be used for divination; however, there is no need to ask because it is fundamentally auspicious. The Commentary analyzes this line as follows: \"With sincerity in the benevolent heart,\" there is no need to ask; rewarding my virtue results in great satisfaction. It points out: \"With sincerity and a benevolent heart,\" the Nine in the Fifth being in the position of a ruler, it is indeed commendable to achieve this, and fundamentally there is no need for divination; fortune and smoothness will always accompany him. The people sincerely appreciate his great kindness and virtues, this grand scenario of people's allegiance brings him immense satisfaction and fulfillment of his aspiration to benefit the masses.

Instability denotes the lack of consistency.\n\nThe meaning of this line text is: No one comes to aid him, yet there are those who attack him; the thoughts he establishes are not maintained consistently, and inevitably misfortune will befall him.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, this line occupies the top of the Yi hexagram. The principle of the Yi hexagram is to \"diminish from the top to benefit the bottom,\" but the top nine fails to achieve this, hence it is deemed \"unfortunate.\"\n\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary explains this line as: \"No one aids him,\" refers to biased words; \"or someone strikes him\" indicates that the attack comes from an external source. This points out that \"no one aids him\" because he has deviated from the principle of the Yi hexagram, which is to sacrifice oneself to benefit others. By changing from diminishing the top to benefit the bottom to diminishing the bottom to benefit the top, he inevitably faces the scorn of the world. His call for benefit can only be wishful thinking. \"There are those who attack him,\" because he oversteps his bounds above the ruler, occupying an unsuitable position, and with his coveting of benefits stoking the anger of both Heaven and people, it's not surprising that external attacks come.\n\nThe Xici commentary on this line remarks: \"A gentleman stabilizes himself before taking action, calms his heart before speaking, and establishes his relationships before making requests. A gentleman who cultivates these three aspects is thus whole. Acting out of danger causes people not to cooperate; speaking out of fear causes people not to respond; seeking without bonds causes people not to support. When none support, harm inevitably arrives.\" As the I Ching says: \"No one aids him, or someone strikes him; establish a firm mind but beware instability, which leads to misfortune.\" \n\nSomeone with virtue first ensures stability in themselves before acting; they calm their heart before speaking; when needing help from others, they first establish friendships, waiting until emotional bonds are formed before making requests. You must establish your ambitions before acting according to them. Without long-term care for the people, without sincerely helping others, how can you expect to be supported by others in the end? Those who draw this line find themselves in a state of being isolated and lonely because they were preoccupied only with making money and seeking personal gain without ever helping others. Frequently indecisive in their actions, changing plans often, others become unwilling to work with them.

Comparatively, the damage caused by thunder and rain is just a minor mistake of the rain, hence this hexagram is named \"Lesser Exceeding.\"\n\nThe \"Lesser Exceeding\" hexagram follows the \"Sincerity Inside\" hexagram, and \"The Sequence of Hexagrams\" explains it as: \"One who is sincere must act, hence it is succeeded by Lesser Exceeding.\" A person with sincerity will certainly take action, and if they cannot grasp the limitations while acting, they may commit a small excess, which is why Lesser Exceeding is discussed afterward.\n\n\"The Image\" explains this hexagram as: \"Thunder on the mountain, Lesser Exceeding; the noble one exceeds in respect, wails with excessive grief, and is excessively frugal in use.\" This points out that the image of the Lesser Exceeding hexagram is Gen (Mountain) below and Zhen (Thunder) above, representing thunder sounding on the mountain. The sound of thunder exceeds ordinary thunder, symbolizing \"a slight excess.\" A noble one should emulate the image of \"Lesser Exceeding,\" slightly exceeding in some ordinary small matters, such as being overly respectful in conduct, overly mournful in funerals, or overly frugal in daily expenses, to correct with a minor excess.\n\nThe Lesser Exceeding hexagram symbolizes slight excessiveness, and it conveys the principle of moderation in action, belonging to the category of upper-middle hexagrams. \"The Image\" interprets this hexagram as: \"A traveler walking across a single-log bridge feels fearful within and watches closely. If he goes with agility, he may pass safely, but if he travels slowly, he certainly won't feel secure.\""},"line_1":{"description":"First Nine: The flying bird brings misfortune.\n\nThe Image says: The flying bird brings misfortune; there is nothing one can do.","interpretation":"At the beginning of six: A flying bird passes through the sky, foretelling danger.  \nThe Xiang Commentary says: A flying bird passes through the sky, foretelling danger, this is something inevitable.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: For those who receive this line, they may not receive the favor of timely opportunities, and disaster may strike suddenly.

Interpretation of the Yao's Words.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: when a bird forcefully flies upward, it encounters danger. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the initial six is a yin line in a firm position. Its nature is soft and weak, yet it is eager and active, like a young bird that has just learned to fly. Its wings are not fully developed, yet it insists on flying high, inevitably leading to danger.\n\nThe \"Image\" commentary explains this line: \"A flying bird leads to misfortune\" means that nothing can be done about it. It indicates that \"a bird forcefully flying upward will encounter danger,\" and this misfortune is self-inflicted, with no way to prevent it.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram, it is advised to consider their actual abilities. When one's capabilities and knowledge are not yet at a certain level, one should not aim for higher positions or seek great wealth.

Grandmother here refers to the grandmother. The meaning of this statement is that when consulting about family matters, one may bypass the grandfather and consult the grandmother. When consulting about important state affairs, in the situation where one cannot directly meet the monarch, one should consult the monarch's close ministers; there is no fault in this.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the second six is a yin line occupying a yielding position, maintaining centrality and uprightness, acting in a very rule-abiding and dutiful manner. In ancient societies with a patriarchal system, one needed to consult the head of the family in matters of family affairs. Here, the younger generation in line two did not consult the grandfather but bypassed him to consult the grandmother, as the household matters are considered trivial; thus, there is no fault. Concerning ministers, it is not acceptable to bypass the monarch; one must consult the monarch. If direct access to the monarch is not possible, one can consult his close ministers only under such circumstances.\n\nThe 'Image' analyzes this line as \"Not reaching his lord,\" and ministers must not exceed their position. It points out that \"one cannot arbitrarily bypass the position of the sovereign,\" as being a minister, one cannot surpass the supreme authority.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, in your workplace, you must abide by the rules and regulations of the organization. When reporting or consulting, focus on the principal leaders; do not exceed your position or consult the wrong target. In the family, also pay attention to respecting elders.

The fourth line is in an incorrect position and should maintain a path of gentleness and compliance, without actively currying favor with or trying to dominate the fifth line to seek heavy responsibilities for oneself. It's best to wait for the fifth line to come and \"meet you.\" In front of the fifth line, do not excessively display competence, but maintain vigilance and adhere to the path of righteousness to ensure peace and safety.\n\nThe \"Symbol\" analyzes this line as follows: \"Do not force an encounter,\" indicating an improper position; \"guard against danger if proceeding,\" implying it cannot be sustained in the end. This points out: \"One must not demand too much; wait for others to willingly meet,\" because the fourth line, being firm in a gentle position, is improperly placed; \"if you take the initiative to proceed, there will be danger,\" suggesting that trying to ingratiate oneself ultimately cannot be sustained.\n\nFor those who draw this line, whether at work or in relationships, you should put yourself in a passive position, waiting for the right opportunity rather than taking the initiative, or it will be challenging to sustain.

The rulers use arrows with strings attached to hunt the beasts hidden in their dens.\n\nFrom the hexagram's perspective, six in the fifth position is a yin line situated in a ruler's position but misplaced, symbolizing poor governance abilities. \"Dense clouds do not bring rain from our western suburbs\" indicates that ancient people believed clouds moving eastward from the west would not bring rain.\n\nIn \"The Image,\" this line is explained: “Dense clouds do not rain, as they have risen above.” It points out that the \"thick clouds covering the sky without rain\" is because yin energy has surpassed yang energy, leading to a lack of harmony and thus no rain conversion.

The virtue of the noble person is like the wind, and the virtue of the common person is like the grass.

Just like some parents who do not want their children to fight or insult others; if the children do so, the parents scold or punish them, while they themselves do not refrain from scolding or hitting. How can they demand this of their children?\n\nAs a king of the esteemed Nine Five position, one must also continuously observe their living environment. However, the king observes not for the sake of advancing or retreating, but for governance. How does the king observe their living environment? The Xiang text explains \"observe the people.\" This means that if the king wants to know if their environment is beneficial, they must assess the sentiments of the people, understanding what they think and their living conditions to discern whether the environment is good or bad for themselves. Why is this? Because if the populace is prosperous and happy, they will naturally support the king; if teeming with complaints, the king's living environment will be poor. If the people are on the verge of rebellion, how can the king's days be peaceful?"},"line_6":{"description":"Top nine: Observing his life, the noble person is without blame.\nThe image says: Observing his life, his aspirations are not yet fulfilled.","interpretation":"Top Nine: Observe the intentions of other tribes; a gentleman can be without error.\n\nThe Commentary says: Observing the intentions of other tribes is due to the situation not being fully understood, leading to an uneasy mind and difficulty in decision-making.","scholar_interpretation":"\nFlat: For those who receive this line, their fortune is not smooth, with ambition exceeding capability.

In terms of the hexagram image, the top nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, high up without power, indicating a retired worthy person not in office or a capable individual with no official position. The \"Image\" says: \"Observe his life\" suggests an unsettled aspiration. This means, \"A gentleman constantly observes the virtue and actions of the ruler,\" because his aspirations are difficult to settle.\n\nIf you left your original position and someone else replaced you; or you wanted the position but someone else got it. You should pay attention to observing the virtue of the current holder, take them as an example, and learn from them. By doing so, you can lay a foundation for your future success. Never view yourself as superior, be hostile, or deride them, as it brings you no benefit.\n\nThe top nine is equivalent to the position of a retired emperor observing without calamity. Understanding human existence, learning about people's customs and hardships through observing others, allows one to consider one's own situation, thus avoiding calamity, because one can take it as a warning.\n\nHexagram observation, fifth line: Line statement: Nine-five: Observe my life, the gentleman has no blame.

The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, the virtue of a small person is like grass; when the wind blows over the grass, it must bend.\" A leader's morality is like the wind, while the morality of subordinates is like grass.

However, this observation is not for personal advancement or retreat, but for governance. How does the king observe his living environment? The image explains \"also to observe the people.\" This means that in order for a king to understand whether his environment is beneficial to him, he must understand the people's sentiments, know their thoughts, and understand their living conditions. Then he can understand whether his own living environment is good or bad. Why? Because if the people are prosperous and joyful, they naturally support the king, thriving; if complaints abound, the king's living environment becomes poor.

Because these two trigrams repel each other and have opposing directions—heaven ascending and water descending—it symbolizes conflict. Similarly, when individuals act out of self-interest and focus on personal gain without unified thought, disputes arise as they compete over interests, ultimately requiring resolution through adjudication.\n\nThe image of the Sòng Hexagram contains two words, \"dispute\" and \"mouth,\" which are the root causes of trouble.

The second and fifth lines have an antagonistic relationship, with a dispute occurring between them. The second line is clearly no match for the fifth line, yet it relies on its belief that no matter the opponent's power or official status, as long as it is justified, it can engage in a lawsuit. However, it must be understood that the lower cannot challenge the higher, and earth cannot force heaven.

Thunder moves and wind follows; this is the greatest perpetual image in nature, which all can see. The sequence of thunder being followed by wind was used by the ancients to illustrate the principle of the mutual following of yin and yang. From this, it is inferred that husband and wife should also be like thunder and wind, always in harmonious coexistence. The preceding hexagram, Affection, concerns youthful boys and girls, while this hexagram speaks of the eldest son and eldest daughter, indicating the transition from youthful romance to a grown, mature, enduring marital relationship.

The Yin softness of the initial six is misplaced and situated at a low position, responding to the nine-four above.

Thus, if this Yao is viewed in terms of male-female relationships or marital affection, it implies a woman’s eagerness for success, pursuing actively yet lacking the rationality and restraint for self-control, which is unfavorable.\n\nThe constancy path of heaven and earth includes the changes of the four seasons; the constancy path of the sun and moon includes the changes of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. People should also emulate the constancy paths of heaven, earth, sun, and moon, not remaining unchanged due to constancy. Constancy is relative; constancy will lead to good results. The Yao text uses \"deeply delve into constancy\" as an example to articulate this principle. Ancient people would settle by the water’s edge, thus the flooding disaster of river water became a hazard in their lives. So, the ancients would timely clear the riverbed to prevent it from becoming shallow, risking overflowing into fields and homes. However, it is unnecessary to clear the riverbed daily. Doing so would be laborious and unrewarding because people would not gain more resources from daily riverbed clearing. Therefore, constant clearing, despite good intentions, results in misfortune."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: Regret vanishes.  \n\nThe commentary states: Regret vanishes for the nine in the second place because one can remain steadfast in the middle path.  \n\nThis implies that there is no remorse because one is capable of adhering firmly to the principle of central correctness.","interpretation":"There are no regrets in moving past one's position.","scholar_interpretation":"Those who obtain this line should maintain contentment and integrity to remain worry-free.

However, due to its position and correspondence to centrality, it can steadfastly adhere to the middle path and remain balanced, thereby eliminating the regret of losing correctness.\n\nThe commentary in the Image explains this line: Nine in the second place \"regret vanishes\" because it can long remain centered. It points out that this line can cause \"regret to dissipate on its own\" because it is capable of steadfastly maintaining impartiality.\n\nOne who obtains this line should remember the insight of the line text, adhering to the principle of impartiality when dealing with problems. In doing so, there will be nothing to worry about: \"A person maintains integrity and remains naturally at ease.\" By conducting oneself according to the correct path, keeping one's stance, everything will become smooth.\n\nIf one currently regrets past actions, it may be beneficial to take a break or shift focus, as regret will dissipate naturally.\n\nFor a woman who obtains this line, it indicates competitiveness and outstanding ability, appearing strong and assertive in the presence of men, and sometimes displaying criticism or nitpicking toward her husband, with some signs of defiance and disrespect. However, the woman is loyal to her husband, with no acts against virtue, so there will be no disaster or regret.\n\nThe nine in the second position is situated at the center of the lower trigram and corresponds to the line in the fifth position, thus preventing regret from occurring. In the hexagram Heng, the nine in the second place can consistently adhere to the path of moderation, neither overly aggressive nor excessively slow, thus allowing permanence with achievement, avoiding any cause for regret."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: If one does not persevere in one's virtue, one may encounter disgrace.

Perseverance brings distress.\n\nExplanation of Yao Text: The word 'or' implies perhaps, sometimes, or frequently. 'Bear' means to endure or suffer. 'Disgrace' refers to humiliation.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: A person unable to steadfastly uphold virtue often faces humiliation. If one insists on not changing, it will lead to difficulties.\n\nFrom the hexagram's perspective, the third line here is a yang line in a firm position, indicating restlessness, impulsiveness, and blind advancement, corresponding correctly to the sixth line above, situated between the inner and outer hexagrams. This can result in unsteadiness and failure to maintain constancy. \"Anyone lacking perseverance cannot maintain their virtue,\" indicating that if one cannot consistently uphold their virtues, they may sometimes encounter shame, making actions difficult.\n\nIn terms of marital or romantic relationships, as the lower trigram represents women, this third line suggests a strong and fierce woman who not only has a spicy temperament but also struggles to persist in traditional feminine virtues, resulting in being shamed. If she persists without change, it will hardly end well.\n\nThe Image analyzes this line: \"Failing to persevere in one's virtue\" means there is no place for such a person to find refuge. It highlights that due to impulsive, reckless actions and an inability to remain steadfast, they eventually find themselves without a place to belong.\n\nThe Yao Text reads: Nine in the Third Place: One who does not persevere in virtue may frequently meet with disgrace. Perseverance brings distress.\n\nThe Image reads: Failing to persevere in one's virtue means no place can accommodate such a person.\n\nThe text implies: Inability to sustain one's moral integrity may lead to humiliation, and keeping to the right path results in concerns and distress.\n\nThe Image explains: One who cannot consistently maintain virtue will find that no place accommodates them.\n\nThe third line is the top line of the lower trigram Xun in Hexagram Heng, which conveys the meaning of following or yielding. Hence, the character of this line should ideally be extremely accommodating, so why does it indicate \"not persevering in virtue\"? Originally, this line is positioned in the middle of the lower inter-trigram Qian, symbolizing strength and movement, and it also corresponds with the sixth line above. Therefore, its following nature is not simple compliance but rather wavering, sometimes following this person, sometimes that one. This behavior represents \"not persevering in virtue,\" thus leading inevitably to \"disgrace\" and \"distress.\"\n\nThe Nine in the Third Place is akin to Lü Bu during the Three Kingdoms, who, despite his bravery and dashing appearance, was never loyal to his lords, always siding with those in power. Consequently, people scolded him as a \"servant of three surnames,\" and eventually, no one dared to take him in, leading to his downfall. This exemplifies the image's statement: \"Failing to persevere in one's virtue, no place can accommodate him.\""},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: There is no game in the field.\n\nThe Image says: The dragon is not in its proper position; how can it succeed in hunting?","interpretation":"In the fourth place, Nine: In hunting, nothing is caught.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Remaining long in an unsuitable environment, how can there be any gain?","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: Those who obtain this line will find that their plans require great effort and are difficult to achieve. Officials will find their fortunes unfavorable, leading to regression.\n\nFu Peirong, a great scholar from Taiwan, interprets:\n\nFortune: Unable to attain the correct position, resulting in futile efforts.\n\nWealth: The location is unfavorable, making it difficult to gain benefits.\n\nHome: The direction is unfavorable; there is disharmony with one's spouse.\n\nHealth: Be cautious when taking medication.","philosophy":"Hexagram Heng, the fourth line, line statement: Nine in the fourth position: There is no game in the field.\n\nInterpretation of the line statement:\nThe meaning of this line statement is that when one goes hunting in the fields, no game is caught.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the nine in the fourth position is a yang line residing in a yin position, which is unsuitable. Although there is a resonance with the first six, actions are often futile and fruitless, akin to going outside to hunt but making no catch.\n\nThe \"Image\" thus analyzes this line: \"Long in a position not appropriate, how can one catch game?\"\n\nThis points out that being in a position for a long time that is not suitable for oneself, how could one catch game? It is evident that the nine in the fourth position might not be diligent in their endeavors; like hunting, not waiting in places where game frequently appears, choosing incorrect locations, or being distracted, wandering aimlessly instead.\n\n\"Long hunting in the mountains will eventually catch beasts; long fishing in water will eventually catch fish. If one is not in the right position, it is like climbing a tree to seek fish, yielding nothing.\" Those who obtain this line in divination may have chosen the wrong direction in their endeavors, resulting in no harvest. If seeking wealth, it might also be hard to obtain.\n\nFor those with this line in divination, it may indicate disharmony in marital relations. The upper trigram of Heng represents men, and the nine in the fourth position is at the start of the upper trigram. In ancient times, men supported the family; if they returned from hunting empty-handed, with what would they provide for the family? This suggests a lack of ability in the man. Due to the yang line residing in a yin position, being unsuitable and lacking stability, it might be due to overlooked talents or a lack of ability, impoverishment, and incapacity to fulfill the man's duty to support the family, which might cause disturbances in the marital relationship.\n\nThe nine in the fourth position also represents a person persistent in long-term endeavors. However, the yang line resides in an even position and is the principal line of the upper trigram Zhen, so it exhibits a joyful movement rather than stillness. This means that the nine in the fourth position is in continuous motion. In hunting, wandering around might catch roaming beasts, but such frequent movements cannot catch birds. Why is this so? Because birds will take flight when startled. To capture birds, one must quietly hide aside, allowing birds to come by. If one is noisy and moving around, the birds will not come."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place means: Persist in virtue and constancy.

Divination brings good fortune to women, while it is dangerous for men.   \nThe \"Image\" commentary says: The line statement indicates that women maintain chastity and virtue, which is auspicious. This aligns with the principle of a wife following her husband throughout life. For men, however, events dictate propriety, and their paths are varied.

Auspicious for a woman, ominous for a man.\" The meaning of this line is: To maintain virtue over a long time and uphold the righteous path. It is auspicious for a woman and ominous for a man.\n\nFor the Six Five line, it depends on whether the one consulting the divination is male or female; both are required to achieve \"perseverance.\" For a woman, it emphasizes marriage and the marital relationship, while for a man, it emphasizes actions and pioneering a career, resulting in different outcomes for men and women.\n\nThe image emphasizes: \"A woman who is genuine and upright will have good fortune, as she remains faithful to one husband throughout her life; a man who follows [another's] lead faces misfortune, for if a man behaves as submissively as a woman, yielding and indecisive, he invites danger.\" A man, when faced with decisions, should be decisive. If he only knows how to follow, like a woman, he will encounter peril. In social situations, a man must adapt and be resourceful, unlike a woman who might quietly conform to outdated customs without any pioneering spirit, potentially failing to even support his family financially.\n\nThe Six Five line, which embodies the qualities of gentleness and flexibility, assumes a position of honor, maintaining the middle path despite not being in an authoritative position. This persistence is auspicious for women because staying with one man for life aligns with the feudal moral teachings. However, it becomes ominous for a man if he acts like a woman. The \"man\" referred to in Six Five is Nine Two and Nine Four. Since Six Five is ranked above Nine Two and Nine Four, they must listen to Six Five. Thus, the text mentions that Six Five's \"husband\" is ominous. Her auspiciousness comes from choosing one of Nine Two or Nine Four as her husband and remaining faithful, hence the auspiciousness. From the hexagram image, it seems she chooses Nine Four. Therefore, Nine Four results in \"no catch in the field,\" as Nine Four corresponds with Six at the beginning. Although there is an inclination towards love, due to the relationship with Six Five, Nine Four cannot progress further with Six at the beginning, hence \"no catch.\""},"line_6":{"description":"Top six: Shocking constancy leads to misfortune.  \nThe Image says: Shocking constancy on high results in great failure.","interpretation":"Top six: Continual movement without rest leads to danger.\n\nThe Image says: When the ruler changes orders morning and evening, and the policies are inconsistent, the result will inevitably be ineffective in all endeavors.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: Those who receive this line will find that seeking fame and profit yields small achievements, but no success in large matters; it is unfavorable for women regarding their husbands and sons.

If he continually changes policies and styles, others will be at a loss. Those who receive this line are advised to have perseverance, exercise patience, and remain consistent to achieve success. If one constantly changes, is restless, and cannot maintain steadfastness, he will not accomplish great things.\n\nFrom the perspective of marital relationships, if one cannot \"maintain constancy,\" cannot remain faithful to one's wife, and instead indulges in external affairs and thoughts, the relationship will inevitably be unstable and result in peril.\n\nOn the sixth: Shaking in persistence, ominous.\n\nThe Image says: \"Shaking in persistence above, achieving nothing significant.\"\n\nThe text means: Continuous agitation over time, is perilous.\n\nThe Image commentary means: The sixth line at the top wavers and achieves nothing, hence it is perilous.\n\nThe sixth line is at the top of the hexagram, but as it is also the top line of the Zhen trigram, it suggests intense oscillation. Being in a high position yet wavering achieves nothing, thus the sixth line is ominous. As stated in the \"Laozi\": \"Governing a large state is like cooking small fish.\" What does this mean? It means that in governing a large state, policies should not be frequently altered. If decrees change constantly, people will struggle to understand the ruler's policies. In ancient times, information was not widely available, so the rulers of large states had to govern like cooking small fish and shrimp—if flipped too often, they would become fragmented. Thus, governing a large state should follow this principle. The sixth line is like a ruler who changes his mind frequently, how can this not be perilous?"}},"9":{"general":{"description":"Little Restraint. Success.

Qian represents Heaven, and Xun represents Wind. It symbolizes favorable weather conditions and the growth of crops, hence the hexagram is named Lesser Accumulation. The original meaning of accumulation is the lush gathering of crops in the field, which extends to mean accumulation in general. Lesser Accumulation refers to a small extent of accumulation. Because the strength is limited and has not yet reached the extent of Greater Accumulation, it needs to develop to a certain degree before achieving great things.\n\nThe Lesser Accumulation hexagram follows the Hexagram of Union, and the Sequence of Hexagrams explains this as: \"Union must lead to some accumulation, thus it is followed by Lesser Accumulation.\" Union implies accumulation, hence it is succeeded by the Lesser Accumulation hexagram.\n\nThe Image Text states, \"The noble person refines their cultural virtues,\" which Xun Shuang believes refers to King Wen of Zhou, who at the time in Xiqi had not yet become Emperor and thus could not bestow favor and governance upon the people, only able to refine his moral character. In fact, this hexagram should describe the regency of Duke Zhou. Duke Zhou, acting on behalf of the young King Cheng, governed the realm, yet still considered himself a subject, thus occupying the gentle position of Six-four with modest virtues.

When the moon is almost full, it rivals the sun; when yin is at its peak, it challenges yang, forcing the noble person to leave, which is ominous.\n\nThe hexagram of 'Xiao Chu' primarily discusses the need to accumulate strength, but once accumulation has reached its limit, excessive abundance can lead to loss. This line warns that accumulation should stop when it becomes full.\n\nFor those receiving this line, it indicates an imbalance in a marital relationship with a dominant female and a weaker male.

Zhen represents thunder, and Gen represents mountain. With the mountain above and thunder below, it is solid on the outside and hollow on the inside.\n\nThe Commentary says: \"Below the mountain there is thunder; thus the gentleman is cautious in speech and moderate in eating and drinking.\" This indicates that the hexagram's image is Zhen (thunder) below and Gen (mountain) above, symbolizing thunder beneath the mountain. This is metaphorically similar to the process of chewing food where the upper jaw remains still and the lower jaw moves, thus symbolizing nourishment. Nourishment must adhere to the correct path, so a gentleman should be cautious in his speech to cultivate virtuous character and moderate in his diet to nurture a healthy body. As spring nurtures all things, one should nurture the worthy and educate the people according to the time. The yang is solid while the yin is hollow; the solid nurtures people, and the hollow is nurtured by people.\n\nFrom the hexagram image analysis, the middle yin line represents the teeth, while the two surrounding yang lines represent the cheeks, lips, and chin around the teeth. With the upper trigram as Gen representing mountain, and the lower trigram as Zhen representing thunder, the thunder below the mountain forms the image of the Yi Hexagram. How can there be thunder under the mountain? It refers to the profound sound within the mountain. Due to changes in the Earth's crust, tremendous sounds can occur within mountains, sometimes leading to landslides or earthquakes, which bury everything on the mountain's surface. The ancients believed this was the mountain \"eating\" things — the most significant image of \"eating\" — so they used this image to represent all aspects of consuming food. When people eat, their mouths also make sounds, thus sharing similarities with the mountain consuming things."},"line_1":{"description":"\nInitial Nine: Setting aside your sacred tortoise, observing my cheeks, inauspicious.\n\nThe Image says: Observing my cheeks is also not worthy of esteem.","interpretation":"At the beginning, if one possesses a large amount of wealth yet envies others' possessions, it will surely lead to perilous outcomes.  \nThe Commentary on the Image states: To envy others' possessions is not a noble behavior.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: Those who receive this line may encounter disaster arising from disputes over wealth and profit.

It is noteworthy that in this Yi hexagram, there are only two yang lines: the First Nine and the Upper Nine. However, the First Nine relies on others for sustenance, while the Upper Nine sustains others.\n\nThe insight from this line is to be self-reliant, to support oneself through one's own efforts. This approach is dignified, affirms one's worth, and ensures longevity. Just like the mythical turtle, it inherently possesses the ability for longevity. Abandoning this ability and seeking sustenance from others is a self-imposed troublesome manner. Many people's lifestyles today mirror this—forsaking self-reliance, depending on others. Although it seems like a way to avoid effort, it is indeed highly perilous.\n\nThe Image says: \"Observe my puffed cheeks,\" it is not admirable. This implies \"seeking sustenance from others,\" focusing on maintaining the body, but due to not adhering to the right way and relying on others, it is not worthy of esteem.\n\nThe First Nine is a yang line positioned in a firm place, inherently capable of self-support. However, it does not utilize its favorable conditions and seeks external favors, hence the warning of \"misfortune.\"\n\nFor one who obtains this line, if you can remain within your duties and be content with a simple life, you will possess calmness and fulfillment.

Explanation of the Line Statement.\n\n\"Inverted\" refers to a reversal. \"Contrary to the norm\" means going against or defying conventions. \"Hills\" originally referred to small hills rising above flat ground; here, it refers to the highest yang line within the hexagram. \"Seek\" refers to advancing forward. \n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: Reversing the way of nourishment, asking subordinates for food to sustain oneself, goes against the norm. Seeking nourishment from above leads to danger in the journey ahead.\n\nLife lesson from the second line of Yi Hexagram: Six Two: Inverted nourishment, contrary to the norm, seek nourishment on hills, peril lies ahead. From this line, it is evident that failing to be self-reliant can be quite risky. Since Six Two cannot sustain itself, it seeks help from subordinates, specifically from the initial nine line below it. It must be acknowledged that this violates the conventional way of providing sustenance. As a superior or leader, one ought to have the capacity to support subordinates; seeking help from them inverts this norm and is akin to an employer borrowing money from employees while failing to pay their salaries, which is fraught with danger. If one does not seek help from below and looks above, seeking external aid also tends to be in vain.\n\nFor those receiving this line, there must be an awareness of self-reliance, as neither above nor below can be depended upon. Subordinates lack the capability to assist you, and external aids will not lend a hand either. The Oracle says: Six Two \"peril lies ahead\" because the act does not follow the same kind. This points out that the external aid Six Two seeks does not belong to the same kind, similar to seeking help from neither relatives nor friends, and hence others will not extend assistance. It is imperative at this time to rely on one's capability and effort to sustain oneself and overcome the predicament. Of course, if someone is willing to help you despite your inability to stand independently, you should not scorn them for having limited abilities or resources while seeking more capable and influential people to assist you. This will lead to the loss of original support and failure to secure new help, resulting in a perilous outcome.\n\nSix Two: Inverted nourishment, contrary to the norm, seek nourishment on hills, peril lies ahead. \n\nThe Oracle says: Six Two calls for caution because moving forward without alignment leads to peril. \n\nThe meaning behind the text is: Eating while lying down violates the conventional ways of nutrition; eating at the edge of a mound leads to hazardous expedition. According to the Oracle, Six Two’s expedition is perilous because his actions will separate him from similar kinds.\n\nThe line corresponds to the position of a noble, so life is relatively affluent, leading to the development of gluttonous and indolent habits. This goes against the principles of healthy living, fattening the body. Naturally, in any contention, it would not be in a winning position, thus \"peril lies ahead.\" Historical records suggest that at that time, affluent people were extremely focused on dining pleasure, being particular about what they consumed. Often, after becoming full, they desired more. Some doctors invented a type of emetic medicine, so people could consume it after a gourmet meal, vomit, and then continue eating. Such habits, combined with a lack of exercise, certainly did not enhance physical fitness, leading inevitably to defeat in conflicts."},"line_3":{"description":"Line three: When one brushes the jaw, perseverance leads to misfortune.

Ten indicates the end of a cycle, so unusable for ten years signifies it cannot be used ultimately.\n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: Violating the proper path of nurturing inevitably leads to misfortune. The notion of seeking to be nurtured by others rather than nurturing oneself is ultimately untenable and offers no benefit.\n\nThe Image says: \"Unusable for ten years,\" because the path is greatly contrary. This indicates that the idea of seeking nurture from others rather than self-sufficiency is fundamentally opposite to the proper path of nurturing, thus violating the principles and methods of nurturing others and caring for oneself.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, it is important to be mindful of one's behavior.

Like a tiger ready to pounce on its prey, focusing intently, striving diligently, there is no disaster.\n\nLooking at this Yi hexagram, the second six line is misfortunate because of \"inverted nourishment,\" whereas the fourth six is fortunate due to \"inverted nourishment.\"\n\nThe commentary explains this fortune: \"the good of inverted nourishment\" is the light shining from above. This means that the fourth six is positioned above, corresponding with the initial nine, and is able to adhere to the correct path. Though it takes from the people, it also uses it for the people, spreading light and kindness broadly downwards. This can be understood as a reflection of current taxation policies, where the government collects taxes from the people and also utilizes them for the people's benefit. Officials' salaries come from the populace, yet they work for the populace. This type of \"inverted nourishment\" aligns with the correct path, bringing good fortune.\n\nThe fourth six line is close to the sovereign at the sixth five position, belonging to a close minister.

The meaning of this line is: although it goes against the principles of nurturing, adhering to righteousness will bring good fortune. One should not traverse large rivers.\n\nThis line offers good advice to leaders who lack personal abilities and whose talents are weak: to follow and comply with superiors. \n\nFrom the hexagram's image, the Yin line occupies the royal Yang position without a proper response, making it difficult to support the people. In an organization, this means difficulty in providing good treatment for employees. However, the fifth line has a reliable support or external aid, represented by the top ninth line. \n\nThe analysis in the Xiang (Image) says, \"The good fortune of maintaining righteousness comes from compliant submission to superiors.\" This indicates that \"being able to safely occupy a respected position results in good fortune\" because one can defer to wise people of strong character.\n\nDespite the inherent weakness and lack of ability of the fifth line, because it holds the position of the ruler, if capable individuals are employed and the advice of wise ministers is accepted correctly, it leads to good fortune. However, due to limited personal abilities, it is best to retreat and maintain stability. \n\nIf one is obstinate, aggressive, and ambitious, the results will likely not meet expectations. \n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, as a leader, it is imperative to accurately evaluate one's abilities.

Therefore, one can only adhere to the righteous path and is unlikely to achieve great deeds. \n\nThe situation of the fifth line is akin to Emperor Wu of Han when he first ascended the throne, with political power held by Empress Dou.

Bearing such a great responsibility, one must guard against danger and fearfulness to obtain good fortune, which also allows one to overcome all difficulties, like safely crossing a great river. The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility, and such a person is often regarded as a heroic figure. The upper nine in this hexagram represents such a person. In the Yi Hexagram, all the other lines below the upper nine look up to it for sustenance, placing a heavy burden on it. This line is similar to Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period, especially after Liu Bei's death, when the latter master Liu Shan was weak and incompetent.

Movement combined with strength suggests vigorous and active yang energy, invigorating people's hearts, leading to potential gains, but only if one adheres to purity and does not act recklessly. Wu Wang ensures gains and brings blessings.\n\nFrom analyzing the hexagram's imagery, Qian represents heaven and is the upper trigram, while Zhen represents thunder and is the lower trigram. This indicates thunder moving under the command of heaven. Zhen's movements must follow the virtues of Qian, avoiding reckless actions outside of these principles, essentially meaning actions should be guided by correct thoughts, which results in \"no recklessness.\"\n\nThe Wu Wang hexagram follows the Fu hexagram. In the \"Sequence of Hexagrams,\" it states, \"Returning leads to not being reckless, so it is followed by Wu Wang.\" Returning to the right path ensures no falsehood. The name of this hexagram is Wu Wang. The character \"Wang\" is composed of \"亡\" and \"女,\" originally referring to a runaway female servant. In \"Shuowen,\" it says, \"Wang, disorder.\" In \"Guangyun,\" it says, \"Wang, falsehood.\" Thus, the extended meaning of \"Wang\" implies falseness, extreme unreality, and disorder. So \"Wu Wang\" means not being false or acting recklessly. The \"Sequence of Hexagrams Commentary\" says, \"Returning leads to not being reckless, so it is followed by Wu Wang,\" meaning the revival of the yang energy stops the yin energy from being reckless, hence Wu Wang follows Fu. The revival of yang also marks the beginning of disaster for yin, and the \"Miscellaneous Hexagrams Commentary\" states, \"Da Chu marks the time; Wu Wang marks the disaster.\"\n\nIn the Tian Lei Wu Wang hexagram, Qian is heaven, and Zhen is thunder—thunder moves under heaven, and all things dare not act recklessly, thus representing Wu Wang. The Wu Wang symbol prevents reckless actions, aligns with objective laws, and does not violate facts. When nothing is done recklessly, things proceed smoothly; otherwise, disaster may occur, hindering development.\n\nThe \"Image\" states: \"Thunder moves under heaven, things correspond with Wu Wang; the early kings responded richly to the times to nurture all things.\" This phrase points out that the hexagram's imagery is Zhen below and Qian above, akin to thunder operating below heaven, symbolizing how heaven uses the might of thunder to warn all things and endows them with a nature avoiding reckless actions or desires; ancient rulers followed the mandate of heaven, adhering to the timing to fully nurture the growth of all things.\n\nThis is the imagery of the Wu Wang hexagram. From common sense, it is inadvisable to leave home during a thunderstorm because of the risk of lightning strikes. The ancients long observed this and considered thunder a punishment for wrongdoers, associating thunder with the symbol of law.

Once the purity of the heart is swayed by delusions and they stubbornly proceed without heeding advice, unexpected misfortune will not be far away.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being positive and proactive, but it is important to emphasize not acting rashly or impulsively. Those who obtain this line are at the beginning stage of their career and must adhere to the right path, proceeding step by step according to procedures and rules to achieve success progressively.\n\nThe initial nine yang line occupies an unusual position and is in a proper position. Although it is the lowest line of the Wu Wang hexagram, it is like the two feet of the Zhen trigram, which imply movement. This is why its actions are proper and auspicious. The initial nine is akin to the person who moved the log for Shang Yang; he followed the notice, moved the log to the north city gate without error, and thus received a reward. Shang Yang's reforms were like this initial nine line; he was faithful in his words and actions, and his reforms were successful.\n\nThe imagery says: “Proceeding without error,” aspiration is achieved. This tells people that \"not acting recklessly or pursuing frivolous desires, proceeding with actions\" will allow the realization of aspirations."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: One does not plow but still harvests, does not weed but still plants the field; thus, it is favorable to have a goal to pursue.\n\nThe Image says: Not plowing but still harvesting means not yet being wealthy.","interpretation":"Line two: Wanting to harvest without cultivating, desiring to plant in untilled fields.

The commentary explains: No plowing and yet having a harvest is because one is not yet wealthy.\n\nThe interpretation of the line is: Plowing means to till the land. Harvesting is to gather crops. Clearing refers to opening up wasteland. The line suggests that one should not expect immediate harvesting when first plowing, nor expect a newly cleared field to immediately become fertile land. Only with such an approach is it beneficial to proceed.\n\nThis line, Six Two, advises that one should deal with affairs pragmatically, \"Don't have unrealistic thoughts, and act with sincerity.\" Do not expect to reap benefits without effort, nor anticipate high returns immediately after an initial investment—this defies natural order.\n\nIf you wish to achieve something, just proceed diligently; don’t think of making a fortune as soon as you start, nor about how to expand after getting rich. There is a saying \"Focus on plowing, not on harvest,\" meaning engage in labor diligently without coveting unearned wealth, do not fantasize about quick results by violating natural laws, for such persistence is advantageous to success in your endeavors.\n\nTo harvest without plowing, and to gain fertile fields without clearing, is certainly beneficial. In ancient times, the first year of land clearing was called \"zai,\" a field tilled for two years was called \"xing tian,\" and after three years it was called \"she.\" Newly cleared fields with dense weeds did not favor planting; once it became \"she,\" the weeds decreased. But how can one obtain land already tilled for three years without clearing it? It can only be obtained through the owner’s reward or purchased. Therefore, Six Two implies that moving forward would result in a great reward, hence \"beneficial to have somewhere to go.\"\n\nIn ancient times, those without land were considered poor, so the commentary says: \"not yet rich.\""},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: An unexpected calamity.

This is easy to understand: if a cow tied by the side of the road at the village's edge is led away by a passerby, everyone in the village becomes suspect. However, those who have always conducted themselves uprightly, with high moral standards, will naturally be excluded from suspicion. Even if people at the time are not entirely familiar with them, their later actions will reveal their character, and they will also be excluded from suspicion.\n\nThe Image says: \"One can remain correct, without blame,\" pointing out that \"adhering to the correct path, without disaster,\" denotes that the virtue of adhering to the correct path is inherently possessed by the individual. Therefore, steadfastly maintaining the correct path from start to finish can save oneself from calamity.\n\nThe Nine in the fourth line is a yang line occupying a yin position, humble and compliant, winning people over with virtue, and thus can attain \"without blame.\" Those who obtain this line are advised to pay attention to their moral qualities, maintaining purity of heart without stray thoughts, thus avoiding any fault.\n\nThe Nine in the fourth is neither responsive to nor compatible with the initial Nine but finds itself in opposition.

In the end, you will find that there is no need to manage it, because the real problem does not exist; it is merely something made out of nothing, not paying attention to it will cause it to vanish on its own. Just like a cow tied to the roadside in the village being led away by a passerby, and the entire village is under suspicion. You should steadfastly continue with your own affairs, without needing to halt and justify your innocence to everyone.

But ultimately evil cannot triumph over virtue, and thus brings good fortune. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the ninth line sits correctly in the position of leadership and maintains integrity.

Wedding ceremonies, too, should not be chaotic. In ancient weddings, there were six steps; the first was the proposal, during which the goose was used, and the last was the welcoming of the bride, where the groom had to insert a goose feather into his hat.

Before acting, think thrice.","philosophy":"The hexagram Ge represents revolution or transformation, symbolized by the combination of Lake over Fire. This hexagram is formed by two different trigrams stacked together: the lower trigram is Li, representing Fire, and the upper trigram is Dui, representing Lake. In this configuration, Lake contains water. When water is above and fire is below, it signifies that the fire below can dry up the water in the lake, transforming it into something of a different nature. Conversely, if the water in the lake overflows, it will extinguish the fire below. Once the fire is extinguished, it too becomes something of a different nature. Fire thriving leads to water drying up; overflowing water extinguishes fire. Thus, the two elements mutually generate and overcome each other, inevitably leading to transformation, hence the name \"Ge,\" meaning change or revolution.\n\nFurthermore, Li symbolizes brightness, while Dui signifies joy. This teaches that the purpose of change is to eliminate the old, bring forth new brightness, and bring joy to people.\n\nThe Ge hexagram follows the Jing hexagram. The Sequence of Hexagrams explains: \"The path of the well must be renewed, thus followed by Ge.\" Over time, a well needs regular cleaning, so after the Jing hexagram, change is required. The Miscellaneous Hexagrams state: \"Ge means removing the old.\" Therefore, Ge symbolizes transformation, implying the removal of the old and the establishment of the new.\n\nThe Image commentary explains the Ge hexagram as Lake containing Fire, representing change. The learned man uses this to manage the calendar and elucidate the timing of the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. It highlights that the hexagram's imagery consists of Fire below and Lake above, symbolizing the appearance of fire within the lake. A large amount of water can extinguish fire; a large fire can evaporate the water. Thus, water and fire mutually annihilate and generate each other, creating transformation. A learned person observes these transformative patterns to devise a calendar, thus clearly distinguishing the changes of the four seasons.\n\nThe Ge hexagram symbolizes transformation and advocates for aligning with natural principles and human needs, considered an auspicious hexagram.

Strengthen: To consolidate, to bind. Yellow: The color yellow, representing the central earth, symbolizes the doctrine of the mean. The meaning of this line's statement is: Use the leather of a yellow cow to bind tightly, to avoid rash actions. The insight given by the initial nine line is that one must seize the right timing for transformation. In the hexagram, the initial nine line is a yang line in a firm position, indicating a sign of striving for advancement. The initial nine line has no response from the ninth line above, and although there is the talent and virtue of yang firmness, there is no support from those in higher positions. Therefore, the conditions for transformation are not mature, and one should not act hastily or seek quick success. The commentary in the \"Image\" section analyzes this line as: \"Strengthen with the hide of a yellow cow,\" and there should be no action taken. It points out that \"using the leather of a yellow cow to bind tightly\" is because the initial nine is in the lowest position of the hexagram, too low and unlikely to accomplish anything. For those who obtain this line, the current situation is not suitable for transformation. You should adopt a conservative attitude and can benefit from this inaction. Even though you feel tightly bound like being tied with a rope, unable to display your talents, this is beneficial for you.

Reform discourse should be studied multiple times with thorough consideration, winning people's trust, in order to succeed.\n\nThe lesson from this line suggests moderation in implementing reform.

Its rightful strength invites danger from rash advancement, while careful adherence risks losing the opportunity. At this time, one should remember the advice from the third line of the Qian hexagram: \"The superior man is continually vigilant, constantly cautious, and blameless.\" Neither rushing ahead nor being overly conservative is prudent; cautious and steady progress is the preferred approach.

This follows the Way of the Earth, striving to emulate the Earth's virtue of yielding, open-mindedness, integrity, and magnanimity. Efforts in daily life will meet expected goals, gradually expanding one's influence, and everything will proceed smoothly.\n\nThose who receive this hexagram should seek a capable and beautiful woman as a partner. This way, the endeavors one intends to undertake will achieve success effortlessly. Even in the face of important or significant events, there is no need for last-minute preparation or sudden learning. Even when encountering tasks never done before or arriving in unfamiliar places, there will be no hindrance, and challenges will be easily resolved.\n\nThe yielding line in the second position is central and properly placed, being in the principal position of the Earth hexagram, so naturally, there will be no adverse matters. Integrity, squareness, and magnanimity are qualities of a minister. By adhering to these qualities and acting consistently without fickleness, one will naturally gain the sovereign's favor. This advises people that when in a favorable position, one must fully utilize their capabilities, shine brightly and warmly, in order to achieve greater development."},"line_2":{"philosophy":"From the perspective of the hexagram image, the second line is a yin line in a yielding position, central and upright, and is a very representative line in the Kun hexagram. This line is both central and upright, which implies that in human conduct, one should also be upright, square, magnanimous, and balanced. \n\nFor those who obtain this hexagram, while there is no need for practice, there is nothing that will not be advantageous. However, this fortune does not arise out of thin air; it requires certain preconditions, namely, to firmly adhere to the \"Way of the Earth\": being straight and square. The \"Image\" says: the movement of the second line, \"straight\" is with \"square,\" and \"not practiced, nothing is unfavorable,\" the Way of the Earth is bright. This means that all actions of the second line are both upright and dare to uphold principles. Even without daily practice, it does not lead to actions that harm the growth of all things. This precisely follows the way of the Earth and allows it to be carried forward, learning the virtue of the Earth's yielding nature, being open-minded, upright, broad, and generous. Such usual efforts will achieve the desired goals, gradually expand one's influence, and everything will proceed smoothly. \n\nFor those who obtain this hexagram, it is important to find a capable and beautiful woman as a partner, as this will allow your endeavors to succeed effortlessly. Even when encountering significant or major events, there is no need for last-minute preparation or sudden learning. Even if you encounter something you have never done before or find yourself in an unfamiliar place, nothing will be unfavorable, and challenges will be resolved easily."},"line_3":{"philosophy":"From the perspective of hexagram imagery, the third line of the six-line configuration is characterized as a yin line occupying a yang position, indicating it is out of place. This particular position, being the highest line of the lower trigram, often suggests danger. In times of high status or peril, one should not exhibit oneself; rather, it is important to comply with others. This necessitates a transformation which, although challenging, must be pursued to avoid misfortune. The line statement mentions \"concealing brilliance,\" meaning to hide one's talents and maintain an awareness of potential troubles, staying modest and reserved. Therefore, the insight offered by this line is to conceal rather than reveal.\n\nThe Commentary on the Words states: Even though the yin has beauty, it is \"concealed.\" Being \"in service to the king,\" one dares not take credit themselves. This aligns with the principles of earth, wife, and minister. Earth's Dao achieves nothing yet brings things to conclusion.\n\nOn a personal level, although you possess literary talent, you must firmly adhere to it and await the right opportunity. When working with a leader, refrain from discussing personal achievements and instead attribute the glory to the ruler; only then can there be a successful end.\n\nThe third line yin line resides in a yang position, indicating it is out of place and not centralized, rendering the situation unfavorable. Therefore, one must hide their talents, adhering to the righteous path. If serving a monarch, do not overly display one's talents; attribute successes to the monarch to achieve favorable outcomes. This hexagram corresponds to the Disapprobation hexagram, symbolizing a loss of authority due to the gathering of yin forces. Thus, one should adopt an approach of outwardly appearing confused while being internally clear, ensuring reputation is preserved until the end."},"line_4":{"philosophy":"Hexagram Kun, the fourth line: Line statement: Six in the fourth position: Sealed bag, no blame, no praise.\n\nExplanation of Kun, the fourth line: \"Six in the fourth position: Sealed bag, no blame, no praise.\"\n\nSealing: The primary meaning refers to tying, binding, or bundling. It also implies containing, encompassing, searching, or seeking, and represents the feather of an arrow.\n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: Closing the bag, there is neither disaster nor praise. \n\nThe insight from this line is: Do not seek merit, but strive to avoid fault. In terms of the hexagram, this line is a yin line in a yin position, gaining its proper place. We know that \"four brings much fear\"; this line has begun to enter the upper hexagram, yet the situation is precarious and unstable, so it is best to be restrained. \"Sealed bag\" refers to tying up the bag, meaning no matter one’s talents, they should be restrained and not revealed, remaining tight-lipped and cautious in action. \"Sealing\" also symbolizes the feather of an arrow; \"sealed bag\" means tying the bag of arrows tightly, only exposing the feather, and not stringing the bow to shoot at critical moments. Although this might not bring praise, it can ensure the absence of calamity. Through the third and fourth lines of the Kun Hexagram as well as the third and fourth lines of the Qian Hexagram, we can observe this pattern: when at the third or fourth position, if one can achieve \"no blame,\" that should be satisfactory.\n\nThe Image says: \"Sealed bag, no blame,\" which means caution harms not.\n\nThis highlights: \"Closing the bag, there is neither disaster nor praise,\" explaining that being cautious and discreet in actions will not cause harm. The example corresponding to this line is after King Zhou wantonly killed the innocent, no one dared to offer advice to him anymore; everyone tightly shut their mouths and avoided needless suffering, ultimately steering clear of disaster.\n\nIf one obtains this line in divination and wishes to invest, it is best to delay. Although this means there will be no profit, there will also be no loss. Avoid lending money to others; keep your wallet tightly closed. Also, keep your mouth shut, refrain from gossip, and do not offer advice to others out of good intentions. Do not rush to gain profit or praise. What is important during this time is: Do not seek merit, but strive to avoid fault.\n\nAt this time, the yang energy is weak, and the yin energy is strong, suggesting the closure of heaven and earth. Hence, a wise person should retreat, harboring great wisdom to observe the movements of the situation, withdrawing to preserve oneself and waiting for the opportunity to emerge. In terms of the hexagram's energy, this time corresponds to the eighth month associated with the Guàn Hexagram."},"line_5":{"philosophy":"The Image says: \"Tying up the bag, there is no fault,\" indicating that caution does no harm. It points out: \"Sealing the bag, there is neither disaster nor praise,\" meaning acting with caution and prudence is not harmful. The example corresponding to this line is when King Zhou indiscriminately killed the innocent, leading to no one daring to offer him advice anymore. Everyone tightly shut their mouths to avoid bringing trouble upon themselves and ultimately escaped disaster.\n\nAfter obtaining this line, if one is considering investing, it is best to delay for a while. Although there may not be gains, there won't be losses either. One should not lend money to others, but rather keep the wallet sealed tight. Also, one should keep their mouth shut, refrain from gossiping, and avoid kindly offering strategies or advice to others. Do not rush to seek gains or praise; at this time, what's important is not to pursue merit but to avoid faults.\n\nCurrently, yang energy is weak, and yin energy is strong, symbolizing that heaven and earth are closing. Therefore, wise people should retreat, conceive profound wisdom, observe the dynamics of the situation, and preserve themselves while waiting for the opportunity to return to public life. In terms of hexagram flow, this is equivalent to the hexagram \"Guan\" in the eighth month."},"line_6":{"philosophy":"From the perspective of the hexagram, the top six is the uppermost line of the Kun hexagram, reaching the highest position. The yin line occupies this high position, which is considered appropriate. However, it might become arrogant, violating the principles of gentleness and adaptability, which advise overcoming hardness with softness. This behavior could manifest as rashness and aggressiveness in actions, leading to failure of plans and potentially causing harm to oneself and others.\n\nThe commentary in the \"Wen Yan\" explains: When yin doubts yang, conflict is inevitable. This is due to disdain for the absence of yang, and thus it is referred to as \"dragon.\" It has not yet departed from its kind, hence it is referred to as \"blood.\"\n\nThis statement means: Because yin distrusts yang, conflict inevitably occurs. This is because they resent their lack of yang. As the top six occupies a high position and holds power, it becomes arrogant, self-styling as yang, and self-styling as the dragon that represents yang. Despite this, as it is a yin line, it cannot escape its yin nature, and this is determined by blood ties, something that cannot be changed."}},"10":{"general":{"description":"Treading.

Lake, being soft, meets Heaven, which is strong, signifying potential danger. \"Treading\" signifies practice; the meaning of the hexagram is to advance pragmatically and solidly.\n\nThe Great Image: The weak encounters the strong, suggesting difficulty in taking action, indicating both danger and hardship.\n\nPrognosis: Initially there will be toil, followed by ease.

Qian represents the heavens, and Dui represents the marsh, symbolizing the ruler with the heavens and the people with the marsh, establishing each in its rightful place.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram imagery, the Lu hexagram has Dui below and Qian above. Qian is strong and virtuous beyond compare, which Dui cannot match.\n\nFrom the form of the hexagram, we can also see that Qian is heaven above and Dui is the marsh below, signifying that while heaven rains down, the earth collects the rainwater as a marsh. This is in accordance with nature and the laws of existence and development of things. Therefore, in learning and practice, one must also follow the laws of nature.\n\nThe Lu hexagram is referred to as Heaven Over Marsh Lu according to tradition. This hexagram’s form is exactly the inverse of Xiao Chu. They are contrasting hexagrams, interacting with one another, one pausing as the other progresses. The Sequence of the Hexagrams states: \"After provisions are accumulated, there is ceremony, hence Lu follows. Lu means ceremony.\" This indicates that after resources are amassed, rituals should be instituted, explaining Lu as \"ceremony.\" The words \"ceremony\" (Li) and \"Lu\" sound the same, and \"ceremony\" must be practiced by people, thus this explanation.\n\nIn the I Ching, the main meaning of the Lu hexagram is the observance of practices and execution. The Miscellaneous Hexagrams states: \"Lu, no dwelling.\" Lu is to progress without halting. The Shuowen dictionary points out: \"Lu, what the foot depends on.\" Lu refers to shoes worn on the feet. In synthesizing these concepts, the original meaning of Lu is shoes, expanding to signify the act of walking, progressing, and observing rituals. The ancients believed human actions must be regulated by ritual to avoid disorder; thus, Lu suggests how one should act, which is ritual.\n\nLu and Xiao Chu hexagrams are reciprocal. Both hexagrams have one yin and five yang elements in their structure, but in the Xiao Chu hexagram, the sixth-fourth line takes its place with yin in yin, occupying the correct position, being gentle and favorable and able to curb the advance of strong forces. However, in the Lu hexagram, the sixth-third line occupies the yang position with yin, and inherently carries a form of rigidity, thus forming a situation not like the gentle containment of the Xiao Chu hexagram but rather encounters strength with strength.\n\nThe symbolic wisdom of the Lu hexagram includes the hat, representing establishment; damaged documents, indicating loss; a woman who is pretty and has an umbrella representing shelter; an outstanding officer sitting at the side of the banners, representing the banner's meaning; and the beacon with the word \"thousand miles,\" symbolizing guarding over a vast domain like a marquis."},"line_1":{"description":"First Nine: Plain conduct, proceeding without blame.  \nThe Image says: The proceeding of plain conduct represents solitary sincerity.","interpretation":"Initial Nine: To live with a simple and honest attitude, there is no calamity.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: Living with a simple and honest attitude means being able to pursue one's aspirations independently.","scholar_interpretation":"Peaceful: Those who obtain this line, if they plan with strategy, will see their wealth and profits increase daily.

Therefore, \"plain footsteps\" has two meanings: one is simple shoes, symbolizing status, as Xun Shuang says: \"Plain footsteps refer to scholars in coarse attire.\" The second is straightforward conduct, meaning adhering firmly to one's creeds, acting according to one's nature, signifying behavior that is upright and pure.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the first yang line is in a firm position, yet at the lowest position, symbolizing having talent but willingly settling for a humble status. This represents the first step of walking forward, not yet tempted by wealth and maintaining one's usual aspirations, thus avoiding fault.\n\nThe Commentary says: \"The plain journey is the wish to walk alone.\" Here \"alone\" means uniquely independent, not following the common trend, pursuing one's resolve not for personal gain. This line illustrates that realizing ideals and fulfilling responsibilities should originate from one's initial intent, walking independently, without compromising with the world.\n\nThose who draw this hexagram can act according to their aspirations, without seeking any profit. Like a recent graduate, they may have great talent but, being new to the workplace, must start from the bottom, not being swayed by immediate gain or outside temptations, independently maintaining principles, thus laying a foundation for future development.\n\nFrom the hexagram's viewpoint, the nine in the second place, in the lower trigram, walks a straightforward path, actualizing its abilities. However, being a yang line in a yin position, it is out of place. Observing the situation of nine in the second, there can be hindrance in advancing, worries in forceful action. Residing quietly while upholding ambitions is auspicious. Quietude does not mean inaction but self-cultivation and continuous self-enhancement.\n\nThe Commentary says: \"The recluse's uprightness brings fortune,\" meaning the recluse naturally finds tranquility without chaos, and their belief in following proper conduct is firm.\n\nThose who draw this hexagram may find themselves in disadvantageous circumstances, unable to fully demonstrate their talents or accomplish great deeds. However, they can use this opportunity to refine themselves. For instance, during the Qing dynasty, the wealthy merchant Hu Xueyan, when dismissed from his job for helping a friend, used his time to practice abacus and accounting, thus building a foundation for future growth. Those who draw this hexagram should seize the opportunity to learn, cultivate themselves, and enhance their abilities.\n\nThe second and fifth lines are not in correspondence, so they do not receive support from the fifth line. Yet, they can remain centered and upright, planning ahead thoroughly. Even without a position, there will be fortune. Walking boldly on straightforward paths while having already considered ways to deal with any danger will naturally lead to fortune. This is akin to what Napoleon said, that a competent leader should always have solutions prepared for unexpected events. This world-renowned military strategist developed his habit of strategic planning in preparation for peacetime, thus making him a constant victor.\n\nThe \"nine in the second\" finds strength and center, akin to a humble hermit, pure in conduct, not seeking fame or recognition, undisturbed by worldly matters, naturally resulting in fortune."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: Treading a path that is smooth and level.

However, it belongs to a yang line residing in a yin position, thus it is out of place. Observing the second line of nine within the hexagram, one might say that advancing encounters obstacles, and forcibly pushing through brings worry. It is auspicious to maintain one's will while remaining concealed. This concealment is not without activity; rather, it involves deep self-refinement and continuous self-improvement.\n\nThe commentary states: “The recluse is upright and fortunate,” indicating that the inner calmness and lack of turmoil is due to a firm commitment to following propriety. This means that a person who maintains a tranquil residence can attain fortune, explaining that an inner calmness naturally remains orderly, with a firm belief in adhering to proper conduct.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram, the situation may be unfavorable, preventing them from showcasing talents or greatly exerting themselves. However, this is an opportunity to refine oneself, similar to how the wealthy merchant Hu Xueyan in the Qing dynasty, during his youth, was dismissed at home without anything to do after helping a friend. He then began practicing with the abacus and learning accounting. This laid the foundation for his future development. Those who receive this hexagram can take this opportunity to learn knowledge, cultivate themselves, and enhance their abilities.\n\nThe second line of nine is not in correspondence with the fifth line of nine, so it does not receive support from the fifth line of nine. However, it can remain centered and keep to its principles, making plans in advance; even though it is not in the right position, it will still be auspicious. Despite walking boldly on a broad road, the mind has already carefully considered ways to handle various dangers. How could this not be auspicious? This is akin to Napoleon's saying that a qualified general should always be thinking of solutions for unexpected incidents. This world military genius had formed the habit of strategic planning routinely, and because of it, he was able to become an ever-victorious general.\n\nThe second line of nine is strong and centered, resembling a carefree recluse, who steadfastly holds to purity, not seeking fame, undisturbed by worldly affairs, and therefore is naturally auspicious."},"line_3":{"description":"Six in the third place: A sightless person can see, a lame person can walk.

Attempting to walk when one is lame signifies a lack of strength sufficient to travel. A tiger injures because line three has a yin line occupying a yang position, which is inappropriate.

This hexagram is formed by the same trigrams (lower and upper), symbolizing the sky, representing the dragon (a virtuous and talented noble), and also symbolizing pure yang and vigor, indicating prosperity and strength. The Heaven hexagram is based on the principles of change and adaptability in all things, with the hexagram statement \"origin, smoothness, benefit, steadfastness,\" signifying auspiciousness and compliance, guiding people to adhere to the virtues of the heavenly way.","philosophy":"The teaching of the third line in this hexagram is: do not make a show of bravado. From the hexagram's imagery, the third line is a yin line occupying a yang position, being out of place and not central. The yin line represents weak ability, suitable only for compliance and guarding, not for blind pursuit to emulate the yang lines and take risks. Those who draw this hexagram should be cautious against being overly aggressive and should adhere to their responsibilities, only doing what is within their capabilities. One should not be overly pessimistic either; your situation is not the worst, like having an eye problem that doesn't prevent seeing, or limb issues that don't stop walking. At such times, choose tasks within your ability to avoid danger. The third line of this hexagram is the only yin line, but unlike the sole yin line in the \"Xiaoxu\" hexagram, its luck is not favorable. Why is this? First, because it is a yin line in an odd position, neither in place nor central; secondly, it stands above two yang lines, making it difficult to gain the support of the yang lines below. Therefore, this third line is like a person who sees with one blind eye or walks with a lame leg, unlikely to go far, thus resulting in danger. Although the third line also desires to rule over the five yang lines, it is as laughable as a warrior aspiring to be an emperor. This statement advises people that their goals should align with their capabilities and position, otherwise they can only bring about danger."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Treading on the tiger's tail.

However, this fourth line also manifests extreme obedience and a sense of fear. \n\nThe commentary states: \"The caution brings eventual good fortune,\" indicating an intention in action. This sentence means that \"feeling fear and anxiety, but with caution and prudence, ultimately leads to good fortune,\" demonstrating that careful adherence to proper conduct can fulfill one's aspirations.\n\nFor those who draw this hexagram, in doing things and interacting with others, they should have the mindset of walking on thin ice, being careful and prudent, to survive danger and achieve a complete outcome.\n\nThe fourth line of nine is located just below the fifth position of the ruler, and thus may commit some mistakes—such as stepping on the tiger's tail. However, the fourth line is able to handle this matter with fear, understand its own faults, engage in inner reflection, and act more cautiously, ultimately leading to good fortune.\n\nThe \"fourth line of nine\" is neither centrally positioned nor correct but is near the ruler, facing the danger of stepping on the tiger's tail.

Therefore, if one receives this hexagram, it may indicate a leadership role. However, as a leader, one must not act willfully and obstinately.

Advancing too rapidly and decisively may sometimes harm others' self-esteem or interests and may obscure the view of potential dangers and traps ahead, leading to troubles.\n\nThose who draw this hexagram should thoroughly contemplate before undertaking any actions and avoid making abrupt decisions, as rash or impulsive behavior will result in danger.\n\nAs one holding the esteemed ninth in the fifth position, if one does not understand how to exercise authority to resolve difficulties, the consequences will be unimaginable.

With upper Dui and lower Xun, the lake water submerges the wooden boat, which forms the image of Da Guo.

Dui symbolizes a marsh or joy, while Xun represents wood or compliance, akin to a marsh's waters flooding a boat, resulting in a significant error. The yin and yang lines are reversed, yang is large, and yin is small, indicating extreme activity and an image of excess; there is inner firmness yet outer softness.\n\nMain Image: The middle four yang lines resemble solid beams, but with yin lines at the beginning and end, the strength is insufficient to support them, suggesting a tendency towards collapse.\n\nFortunes: There is an image of strength not being sufficient to meet one's desires, leading to an overwhelming burden, multiple worries, with a need to guard against legal entanglements and water hazards.\n\nCareer: There are hidden dangers and even crises in business, necessitating utmost caution and prudence. Adhering to the middle path is crucial, using humility and kindness, with boldness and meticulousness, seeking assistance from others. Resorting to unconventional methods and taking risks may be necessary under specific circumstances.\n\nCommerce: Impatience and overly rapid development prompt the need for contraction and adjustment. Competition is at a disadvantageous stage, so avoid overconfidence and obstinacy. Constantly evaluate the situation and act when opportunities arise. When there is assured confidence, one should not shy away from taking risks to achieve improvements in conditions.\n\nReputation: It is most undesirable to seek impractical accolades, leading to great fame not matching reality. Only through humility, cautious actions, devoted effort, and disregard for public gossip, while steadfastly pursuing initial goals, can success be achieved.\n\nMarriage and Romance: Self-awareness is of utmost importance; do not rush for success. Careful consideration and proper means are vital for achieving success. However, using necessary shrewd strategies is not out of the question.\n\nDecision-Making: In critical times, improper handling can be extremely disadvantageous. Addressing the actual situation requires neither rash actions nor indecision, but rather a blend of firmness and softness. Seek others' opinions with humility, act cautiously, pursue boldly, unafraid of rumors, to strive for an improved situation.","philosophy":"The Hexagram Daguo (Great Exceeding) is formed by stacking different trigrams, with the Xun trigram below and the Dui trigram above. Dui represents marshes and joy, while Xun represents wood and compliance. Marsh waters flooding a boat results in a great error. The interactions between the yin and yang lines are reversed, with yang being dominant and yin subordinate, indicating abnormal behavior and a sense of excess, being firm internally and gentle externally.\n\nGuo signifies excess or exceeding boundaries. The Daguo Hexagram follows after the Yi Hexagram. The Sequence of Hexagrams states: \"Without nourishment, one should not act, hence received is Daguo.\" Only after nurturing and achieving success can one take action, but action can easily become excessive.\n\nThe Image says: \"A marsh submerging wood, this is Daguo. The noble one stands alone without fear, retreating from society without distress.\" This passage from the Image explains: the upper trigram is Dui representing marshes and the lower trigram is Xun representing wood. The top marsh submerging the bottom wood boat symbolizes the hexagram's representation of excess. Upon observing this hexagram, the noble person uses the lesson of a weighty boat capsizing as a caution, realizing that in facing disaster, one should uphold integrity without compromising, reside in peace without seeking office, and maintain tranquility and simplicity.\n\nThe Daguo Hexagram symbolizes extreme excess, belonging to the hexagrams of medium to lower quality. The Image interprets this hexagram: Dreaming of gold and silver at night, but waking to find nothing, now is the time to seek fundamental duties, realizing that disorganized thoughts are but idle worry.\n\nThe name of this hexagram is Daguo. The Shuowen explains: \"Guo, means crossing.\" It is evident that \"guo\" signifies passing through or crossing over. Its extended meaning implies excess or transcendence. As people's living conditions improve, they pursue culinary cultures, yet this leads to an excessive pursuit of pleasure. How can one avoid continuing down this path? This calls for significant transcendence in thought and action. Therefore, after the Dun Hexagram comes Daguo Hexagram. The Sequence of Hexagrams Commentary explains: \"Without nourishment, one should not act, therefore received is Daguo.\" This is another perspective on the order of the Yi Hexagram, suggesting that only when a person is well nourished do they have the energy to work."},"line_1":{"description":"First line: Using white rushes brings no blame.  \nThe Image says: Using white rushes, softness is below.","interpretation":"First Line: Reverently placing offerings on a mat of white straw allows one to avoid calamity.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: “Reverently placing offerings on a mat of white straw”—a soft thing is laid underneath, just like the Yin line at the bottom position of the hexagram.","scholar_interpretation":"Balance: Those who obtain this line should act cautiously, and financial benefits can be secured.

White thatch signifies pure, soft grass, implying sincerity, purity, and humility. \n\nThe meaning of this oracle is: during a ritual, placing vessels on a mat of white thatch ensures extra stability and prevents disaster. The lesson from this line is: \"A careful voyager can sail a thousand years.\" Normally, placing the vessels directly on the ground is sufficient during rituals, but as a precaution, one places a mat underneath the vessels to ensure utmost care, hence no mistakes will occur.\n\nThe \"Image\" explains: \"Placed upon white thatch,\" symbolizes softness below. Here it suggests that \"placing a white grass mat beneath the vessels\" indicates extremely careful and cautious behavior, thus averting calamities.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, you are facing a force stronger than yourself, so there's no need to strive for dominance or comparison, as your own power is weak. To avoid harm, you must be extremely cautious, demonstrate extraordinary humility and respect, only then can you avoid unwarranted disasters and ensure safety."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second line: A withered poplar sprouts, an old man takes a young wife, there is nothing that is not beneficial.  \nThe image says: An old man with a young wife, excessive yet mutually beneficial.","interpretation":"Nine in the second place: A withered willow puts forth sprouts.

An old man takes a young wife. There is nothing unfavorable.\" \n\nExplanation of the line's meaning: The poplar refers to a tree, and \"sprout\" means new shoots growing at the root of the tree. The meaning of this line is that the roots of a withered poplar tree have grown new branches and leaves, and an elderly man has taken a young wife, which is without disadvantage. \n\nThis line symbolizes the image of withered wood encountering spring. From the perspective of the hexagram, the yang energy is too strong and requires the harmony of a yin line. The nine in the second place lacks a corresponding line above and must look back to the initial six to achieve the union of yin and yang. The nine in the second place is central and in harmony with the initial six, full of vitality. \n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, if a man, it suggests they may encounter a younger woman in marriage, and a union with her is appropriate, possibly resulting in offspring. In a career context, it may indicate encountering a good project or an excellent assistant, causing a previously declining career to revive and become successful, leading to benefits. \n\nThe nine in the second place occupies the lowest line of the Thunder trigram in the Ta Kuo hexagram, which is associated with the meaning of an old man in the Heaven trigram. Moreover, the harmony of the nine in the second place with the initial six suggests the image of an old man marrying a young woman. In the male-dominated society of ancient times, an older man marrying a younger wife was considered a joyous event, hence \"there is nothing unfavorable.\""},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.

Officials should be wary of being demoted. \n\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\nLuck: Stubborn and self-opinionated; success turns into failure.\nWealth: Relying solely on oneself leads to loss of both wealth and resources.\nHome: The house suffers damages, making it difficult to live in; unfavorable for marriage.\nHealth: There may be unexpected mishaps.","philosophy":"The line statement of the third line of the hexagram Great Exceeding is: Nine in the third place: \"The ridgepole is bowing, misfortune.\" Interpretation of the line statement: The meaning of this line is that the beam of the house bends under excessive pressure, inevitably leading to misfortune. The insight from this line is: rigidity easily leads to breaking.\n\nThe hexagram statement of Great Exceeding is \"the ridgepole,\" and the outcome is \"success,\" but why does it turn into \"misfortune\" in this line? This is because, in the hexagram statement, it is advising one to \"strengthen moderately\" and \"harmonize strength and flexibility,\" which leads to success. In this particular line, the principles of harmonizing strength and flexibility are not followed. Instead, there is inflexibility, persistence in one's views, recklessness, and lack of resilience, resulting in no one willing to follow or assist, inevitably leading to misfortune.\n\nAs stated in the Image: \"The misfortune of the ridgepole,\" there cannot be any assistance. It indicates that \"when the ridgepole of the house bends under heavy pressure, it inevitably leads to danger\" because excessive rigidity prevents further support, otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.\n\nIn your work, you may be quite capable, playing a leading role and bearing heavy responsibility. However, if your attitude is domineering and you persist obstinately, ignoring advice—such as insisting on completing in a day what cannot possibly be done in a day—others may perceive you as showing off and unwilling to help you. You thus complete the task alone, exhausting yourself in the process.\n\nAlthough the spirit of not giving up in the face of difficulties is commendable, sometimes human capability is limited, and it would be better to think of alternative approaches like \"indirect solutions.\" Without understanding these adaptable methods or employing flexible tactics, the outcome will likely be failure.\n\nThe Nine in the third line corresponds with the top six, where the Nine in the third represents a portion of the ridgepole and is solid, while the top six represents an end of the ridgepole, which is soft and humid due to its yin nature. Therefore, this section of the ridgepole becomes damp and bends. In the extended meaning, it suggests health deterioration due to a woman, or it can also be understood as changing one's loyalties by listening to a woman's words. The outcome is naturally perilous."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: The ridgepole is raised high, auspicious.

Explanation of the Line Text: Long: to arch upward or to curve upward in the middle. The meaning of this line text is that when the beam of a house arches upward, it brings auspiciousness; however, if other incidents occur, such as infestation, there might still be issues. The fourth line is close to the revered fifth, representing ministers near the ruler, a pillar of support. The analysis in \"Image\" states: \"The auspiciousness of the beam arching upward\" indicates it does not curve downward. Here, it points out that \"the beam of the house arches upward, overcoming the curve, which brings auspiciousness\" because the fourth line itself can prevent the beam from bending downward. \n\nThe fourth line is a yin line in a yang position, appropriately balanced between firmness and gentleness, possessing both the talent of yang and the virtue of gentleness. Situated in Hexagram Da Guo, yang lines often rush forward impulsively and act willfully, making the fourth line remarkably commendable, thereby attaining auspiciousness. \n\nFor those who receive this line in a divination, although the workload is heavy, possibly bending one's back, it is important to stay energized, maintain high morale, correct minor faults, and guard against unexpected changes that might result in disgrace. At the same time, one must combine firmness with gentleness, balancing exceptional talent with a humble attitude, to achieve auspiciousness. Similar to the second nine, the fourth line is akin to a dampened beam. Because it corresponds with the first six, it also has the imagery of bending due to dampness or due to a woman’s inconstancy. Fortunately, the fourth line is in the upper trigram, so it will only bend upward, not downward. For a house, a beam curving upward will not cause the roof to collapse, hence it is auspicious. However, there will be other concerns of regret, and why is this? Because it is damp. Its implication is that he listens to a woman’s words and may be led to betrayal because of a woman, hence there will be matters of regret."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: The withered poplar produces flowers, the old woman obtains a young husband, there is no blame and no praise.\n\nThe Image says: The withered poplar produces flowers, how can it last long?

There is no blame, but it is not worthy of praise. \n\nThe insight from this line is not to pursue short-term, illusory prosperity.\n\nThe Xiang analysis states: \"The withered poplar blossoms, how can it last long? The old woman and the young man, it would be shameful.\"\n\nIt points out here: \"The withered poplar blossoms again,\" how can this superficial appearance endure? \"An elderly woman marries a young man,\" such a marriage is considered deeply shameful.\n\nIn comparison to other mismatched marriages, the line at Nine Two speaks of an old husband and a young wife, which is \"without blame,\" while in this line, an old wife paired with a young husband, in terms of yin and yang complementing each other, may be considered \"without blame,\" but the \"blossoming\" cannot last and soon withers, hence it is \"without praise.\" Additionally, the old woman is deemed barren, so ancient views on such a marriage were negative.\n\nNine Five is the position of a ruler, referring to a leader within an organization. As a leader, one should not covet short-lived prosperity like the blossoming of withered poplars, but should seek thorough regeneration, growing new branches to reverse decline. For instance, when a company's management borrows money to cover losses, it is a short-term tactic. The truly effective approach is to reform the company’s system, allowing it to generate profits, thereby achieving genuine, lasting prosperity.\n\nNine Five: The withered poplar blossoms, an old woman gains a young man as her husband, without disaster but also without honor.\n\nThe Xiang commentary says: The withered poplar blossoms, how can it last long? The old woman and the young man, it would be disgraceful as well.\n\nThe text means: The withered poplar grows flowers, and the elderly woman obtains a young man as her husband. There is no disaster but also no honor.\n\nThe commentary means: The withered poplar produces flowers, but how can it last long? An elderly woman getting a young man as a husband is a shameful matter.\n\nHere, Nine Five refers to the \"young man,\" while the \"old woman\" refers to the topmost line,  the Upper Six. In the overall hexagram image, the lower trigram is Xun, wood, while the upper trigram is Dui, which represents flowers, hence the line “the withered poplar blossoms.” The Nine Five yang line pairs with the Upper Six yin, representing the image of the old woman (Upper Six) obtaining the husband (Nine Five)."},"line_6":{"description":"Top six: Crossing difficulties and immersion; misfortune, no blame.  \nThe image says: The misfortune of crossing difficulties cannot be blamed.","interpretation":"Top six: Blindly wading through water, the water is deep above the head.

Explanation of Judgment Interference: to hinder, to dissuade. Submersion over the head: facing mortal danger.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: Crossing through water so deep that it submerges one’s head is perilous, but there is no fault.  \n\nFrom the hexagram imagery, Line 6 is situated at the uppermost position of the entire hexagram. The symbolic meaning of Hexagram 28 is like water engulfing a wooden boat; Line 6 symbolizes the river water reaching over the head. The predicament of Line 6 is driven by the circumstances, and there is nothing that can be done about it. However, because Line 6 is a yin line in a yin position, it is appropriately placed. Although there is danger, there is no fault, and it should not be blamed.\n\nThe Image Commentary says: \"The danger of crossing too deep\" is beyond reproach.

Therefore, it reflects the image of crossing a river. The entire hexagram depicts the image of marsh water exceeding the treetops, and Line 6 is eager to cross the river, standing amidst a vast marsh exceeding the treetops, hence \"submersion over the head.\" The outcome is inevitably perilous.

Originally, Qian represents Heaven and should be above, while Kun represents Earth and should be below, but in the Tai hexagram, Kun above and Qian below is very auspicious. The upper trigram is Kun, representing Earth, which is associated with Yin energy; the lower trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, which is associated with Yang energy. Yin energy is heavy and sinks downward, while Yang energy is bright and rises upward, resulting in the interaction of Yin and Yang. If Yang energy rises without restraint, it will deplete its energy and produce no outcome; if Yin energy sinks without restraint, it will also deplete its energy. Therefore, for Yang energy to rise, it is covered by Yin energy; for Yin energy to sink, it is supported by Yang energy. The interaction of Yin and Yang allows for a seamless connection between above and below, creating a harmonious interaction between Heaven and Earth, ensuring peace and prosperity for all things.\n\nThe \"Image\" says: \"Heaven and Earth interact, Tai; the sovereign grasps the way of Heaven and Earth, supporting and facilitating the people's needs.\" In \"Image,\" it is pointed out that the Tai hexagram's image is Qian (Heaven) below Kun (Earth) above, with Earth energy rising and Qian energy descending, symbolizing Earth energy residing above Qian energy. The ascension and descent of Yin and Yang energies lead to their mutual integration and harmonious passage. It is at this time that the ruler must seize the opportunity, skillfully managing and balancing affairs to realize the way of Heaven and Earth's interaction, fostering the conditions where Heaven and Earth generate all things, and protecting and blessing the populace to ensure their well-being and prosperity.\n\nThe Tai hexagram symbolizes smoothness and reaches enlightenment on the principle of adapting according to time, being a middle-class hexagram. \"Image\" interprets this hexagram as: \"A well-read scholar enters the examination hall, passes with flying colors, returning home triumphantly.

In the \"Explained Text,\" it says, \"Tai, great indeed.\" The commentary on \"Rites of Zhou\" says, \"Tai means the great of the great.\" This shows that the meaning of Tai is exceedingly vast.

Instead, they should be open and honest with each other, working together to support the monarch. This will lead to a situation of national peace and prosperity.\n\nIn terms of the hexagram imagery, the position of six-four is right next to the honored nine-five, situated at the confluence of the yin and yang of both upper and lower elements. Above there are leaders, below are subordinates. If one can be both loyal and just, maintaining unity with superiors through humility and showing respect to subordinates, a peaceful and harmonious scenario will emerge.\n\nOn a personal level, it is important to maintain good relationships with neighbors and colleagues. Even if one’s career advances and their position is elevated, they should not become prideful and forget themselves.\n\nLine six-four states: Graceful but not wealthy, associating with neighbors, without precaution but with sincerity.\nThe explanation suggests: Being graceful but not wealthy is due to lack of substantial support. Associating without precaution but with sincerity is because it is their central desire.\n\nThe text implies: Being gracefully unwealthy, in interaction with neighbors, without precautions, harboring sincerity. The explanation is that being gracefully unwealthy is due to a general lack of substance. Not being cautious yet maintaining sincerity stems from the genuine intention within the heart.\n\nHow could a state minister holding the line six-four be unwealthy and flighty? As it turns out, he is an honest and incorrupt official. In a peaceful era, how could there be prosperity without honest officials? If all state ministers were wealthy and corrupt, how could the common people be prosperous? How could there be a peaceful era? Therefore, a prosperous era requires not only a good emperor but also good officials. The state minister of line six-four is admirable, approachable, sincere, and trustworthy. People interacting with him need not hold guarded hearts. Figures like Ji Xiaolan and Liu Luoguo, as portrayed on television, exemplify such honest officials."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: The emperor Yi marries off his younger sister, with the blessing of great fortune.\n\nThe Image says: With the blessing of great fortune, one attains what they sincerely desire.","interpretation":"Line Five: Yin Emperor Yi marries his daughter to King Wen of Zhou, thereby obtaining blessings, which result in great auspiciousness and benefit.\n\nThe \"Image Commentary\" says: The acquisition of blessings and great auspiciousness is because the Line Five position resides at the central position of the upper hexagram, which symbolizes a person conducting affairs with moderation and righteousness, thus ensuring success in their endeavors.","scholar_interpretation":"Fortune: Those who receive this line will gain recognition and promotion from others, or will marry and have children, leading to happiness and peace.

When a feudal state becomes strong and prosperous, its leader will seek to build relations with you. How? By marrying their sister or daughter to you. This is the classic governance method in a feudal society. Before the Qin dynasty, there was the system of enfeoffment, and feudal lords strengthened unity through marriage alliances, which eventually led to internal strife and rebellion. From the Yellow Emperor's era to the Warring States period, most wars were fought over power struggles among the ruling class who were related by blood.\n\nIn the I Ching, the mention of \"Di Yi's marriage of his sister\" repeatedly indicates that the Zhou dynasty considered this a matter of pride. The Shang Dynasty's emperor Di Yi married his sister to King Wen of Zhou, which was indeed a significant event for the Zhou dynasty. The Zhou prospered due to this blood relation with the Shang, and the fact that King Zhou of Shang did not kill King Wen also had some connection to this blood relationship. King Wen was the uncle-in-law of King Zhou, and as King Wen was relatively honest, King Zhou naturally did not have the resolute intention to remove King Wen.\n\nThe strategy of \"Di Yi's marriage of his sister\" can still be seen today with the \"six and five\" capturing softness and harmony, connecting with \"two and nine\" above and below achieving smooth interaction. For instance, two large competing companies often become allies or familial through a marriage, turning hostility into friendship. The example of the \"Three Soong Sisters\" before liberation is a successful model of marriage alliance; as there are many books about the \"Three Soong Sisters,\" it will not be elaborated here.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram, it signifies that after painful and patient waiting, one's long-held desires and wishes in the heart are finally realized, and joy has arrived."},"line_6":{"description":"Top line six.

However, at the end of \"peace,\" it returns to \"stagnation,\" akin to the collapse of the city walls, where the earth from the walls would pile back into the ditch. This is the principle of \"the city returns to the ditch.\"\n\nThe Image says: \"The city returns to the ditch, its fate is disorder.\"\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram, it is important to understand that their situation will turn in an unfavorable direction.

From the perspective of the hexagram, Qian symbolizes Heaven and Gen symbolizes Mountain. When there is a mountain under the heavens, the mountain stands tall as the heavens recede. The positive declines as the negative rises; small-minded people gain power, while the noble withdraw to protect their wisdom, waiting for an opportunity to save the heavens. From another angle, the lower trigram Gen carries the meaning of stillness, rather than retreat. It suggests that when circumstances are unfavorable, one should be cautious in one's words and actions, and maintain harmonious relations with others. Gen, following the Qian, wishes to advance but is blocked by the mighty Qian, and attempting to forcibly pass would result in a struggle which would clearly lead to defeat, as Gen is no match for Qian. Therefore, to preserve one's strength, Gen temporarily halts and takes a course of avoidance.\n\nFollowing the Hexagram of Constantness, the \"Sequence of the Hexagrams\" explains this way: \"Things cannot stay long in their place, thus it follows with Retreat. Retreat means to withdraw.\" The Hexagram of Constantness centers on endurance, while the next step involves yielding to make future advancement possible. \n\nThe \"Image\" explains it thus: \"There is a mountain under heaven, symbolizing Retreat; the noble keeps a distance from the petty, being stern without malice.\" Here it points out that the hexagram of Tui, with Gen (Mountain) below and Qian (Heaven) above, represents mountain under sky, symbolizing withdrawal and concession. As high as the mountain may reach, the heavens remain higher, seemingly retreating before the towering mountain, but always remaining lofty above it. A noble person should maintain a certain distance from ignoble people, with an attitude that clearly defines boundaries, in order to naturally evoke a commanding presence that deters the petty.\n\nThe lesson imparted by the Hexagram of Tui is the concept of retreat from the world to save it; it differs from the promotion of reclusive virtue in the hexagrams of Minor Restraint and Major Restraint, as well as from conformity with others in the hexagram of Following, and unlike the cultivation of humility in the hexagram of Modesty. It promotes a survival strategy in a special environment, emphasizing coexistence with kindness and timely advances and retreats. A temporary pause or compromise is made to ensure future success; at this time, retreating from the world aims for a better ability to later save it.\n\nThe Hexagram of Tui represents withdrawal and belongs to the lower hexagrams. Tui is also a hexagram of decrease, representing the month of June. The \"Image\" comments on this hexagram: \"Thick clouds obscure the sun, bearing no light; it advises against long journeys, and marriage and wealth pursuits are both unfavorable; be wary of quarrels coming to your door.\""},"line_1":{"description":"Initial Six.

Do not use it for any venture.\" Explanation of the line:\n\nTail: refers to the rear. Danger: refers to peril, hazard. \n\nThe meaning of this line is: when withdrawing is not timely, falling behind will be dangerous. It is not advisable to take action at this time.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the first six is a yin line, which resides in a soft position, embodying characteristics of indecisiveness and hesitation. When a crisis arrives, one ought to have withdrawn earlier, but hesitated and missed the opportunity. At this point, retreating is too late, and it will certainly be perilous. Having missed the chance to retreat at the right time and falling behind, there is no need to retreat further. One can remain calm and steadfast in a safe place, observing changes without taking any action, otherwise, it will be increasingly disadvantageous.\n\nThe Interpretation of the Image analyzes this line by stating: \"The peril of the tail of retreat, what disaster comes if one does not proceed?\"\n\nThe Interpretation indicates: missing the opportunity for retreat yet attempting it will bring misfortune, but remaining still and observant will not cause harm. This is because the first six is a yin line situated in a soft position, with a gentle character and humble status, hence no major calamity will occur.\n\nThe text itself means: fleeing falls to the last, dangerous, do not proceed.\n\nThe interpretation suggests: fleeing and falling behind brings danger, how could not proceeding result in sudden difficulty?\n\nIn times when petty persons gain power, wise and capable gentlemen are always able to foresee changes early and retire promptly. If retreat is not sufficiently timely and one is the last to do so, danger will ensue. For instance, when petty individuals hold power, virtuous ministers may no longer hold office, and thereby face persecution by the petty. Thus, it is essential to seize the right opportunity to retreat.\n\n\"Dun's tail\" also carries an alternate meaning, relating to the survival rules within the animal kingdom. In the animal world, lions prey on antelopes. Although lions are fierce, they do not run as fast as antelopes, so both have their advantages, neither able to obliterate the other. Yet, lions also train to run faster, with the aim of outpacing the slowest antelope to gain food and avoid starvation. Antelopes, in turn, continually increase their speed to ensure they are not the last, to avoid being caught by lions. The antelope that runs last becomes the \"tail of retreat,\" facing danger."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: To hold it steadfast with the hide of a yellow ox, no one is able to easily remove it.\n\nThe Image says: Holding fast with the hide of a yellow ox signifies firm resolution.","interpretation":"Six in the second place: Capture and bind with the hides of yellow cattle, tightly fastening it so that it cannot be released.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: Binding with the hides of yellow cattle signifies a firm resolve.","scholar_interpretation":"Line: For those who receive this line, there are disputes within the family, but maintaining usual roles and duties brings no worries, and farmers have the joy of gaining livestock.  \nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Pei-jung:  \nFortune: Although talented, achieving fame and success is difficult.  \nWealth: Hold onto your principal, selling out is not timely.  \nHousehold: Moving is beneficial; breaking off an engagement is not easy.  \nHealth: Exercise consistently.  ","philosophy":"The second line of the Dun Hexagram, line text: Six in the second place: Tying it with the hide of a yellow ox, no one can disentangle it.\n\nExplanation of Line Text:\nTo tie: means to secure, to bind.\nHide: refers to leather.\nEntangle: the same as \"undo\", to disentangle.\n\nThe meaning of this line text is: Using ropes made from the hide of a yellow ox to bind, no one can escape from it.\n\nThe second line describes a situation of firm will, steadfastly refraining from retreating. The second line, being a yin line in a soft position, is in position. It denotes holding to the center and maintaining righteousness, carefully following the principle of stillness. Furthermore, it responds to the fifth yang line of the ruler, showing resilience and foresight.\n\nIn \"The Image,\" this line is analyzed this way: Using the hide of a yellow ox, a firm will.\n\n\"The Image\" indicates: \"Like using the hide of a yellow ox to bind,\" it means to firmly hold onto one's aspirations, not wavering in any circumstances.\n\nFor those who draw this line, pay attention to observing your surroundings. Although the influence of petty people is strong and the situation may be unfavorable to you, if there is a certain unshakeable reason requiring you not to retreat temporarily, then you must strengthen your will and hold firm until you gain some rewards.\n\nSix in the second place: Tying it with the hide of a yellow ox, no one can disentangle it.\nThe Image says: Using the hide of a yellow ox, a firm will.\n\nThe meaning of the text is: Using ropes twisted from yellow ox hide to tie, no one can escape.\n\nThe meaning of the image is: Using ropes twisted from yellow ox hide to tie, is to solidify his resolve.\n\nIn Chinese, there's an idiom \"heart like a capering monkey,\" describing one's mind as uncontrollable as a monkey swinging from branches, and thoughts like a wild horse running free. This is the greatest weakness of people. Thus in \"Journey to the West,\" the monk rides a white dragon horse symbolizing the conquest of the \"wild horse\" and placing a tightening spell on Sun Wukong symbolizing overcoming the \"capering monkey.\" This is an ancient Chinese way of maintaining one's health by defeating such distractions, keeping the mind calm and tuning the spirit. This theory comes from the \"Book of Changes.\" Here, the second line uses ropes twisted from yellow ox hide to bind oneself, not to tie one's body, but to bind one's will, ensuring it does not waver."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: Tied retreat, there is affliction and danger.

Therefore, it is said that maintaining servants is auspicious, meaning one should temporarily nurture oneself and heal, avoiding hasty actions.","scholar_interpretation":"Peaceful: Those who receive this line often encounter numerous disasters and difficulties. The virtuous can benefit from their wife's help or gain in family members.

It has no supportive connection with the topmost ninth line, with which it is incompatible, while it closely associates with the second line and the first line below, suggesting an image of being close to petty people and distant from virtuous ones. Under the influence of two yin lines, there is a danger of quickly falling into decay.\n\nFor those who receive this line during divination, it is wise to observe the surrounding friends and associates closely. If one becomes friends with malicious individuals and cannot quickly sever ties and distance from them, they will soon become accomplices and be implicated as well. However, if one can use their innate righteousness to prevent negative influences from others, peace and good fortune will follow.\n\nThe commentary on this line explains: \"The danger of being restrained from escaping is akin to being afflicted with a severe illness,” resulting in great fatigue. The notion of \"keeping servants and concubines results in fortune\" implies that being in a situation of restraint makes achieving great accomplishments impossible.\n\nThose receiving this line in divination should remember not to succumb excessively to the influence of friends and the environment, and to be the master of their own will. Do not let emotions run rampant, as this will leave you exhausted and hinder your work.\n\nNinth Three: Being restrained from fleeing is dangerous, akin to having a severe illness; maintaining servants and concubines is fortunate.\n\nThe symbolism states: The danger of being restrained from fleeing causes exhaustion, similar to a prolonged illness. Keeping servants and concubines is fortunate, suggesting that major enterprises are not feasible.\n\nThe text means: Restraining those who flee presents a risk akin to severe illness, while maintaining servants and concubines brings fortune. \n\nThe commentary implies: The danger of restraining those who flee is like being exhausted from prolonged illness. Maintaining servants and concubines brings fortune, indicating that great ventures are not possible.\n\n“Ninth Three” aligns gently with the second line, with one's heart bound. It is as if afflicted with a severe illness, hesitant and uncertain when trying to retreat, hence there is peril.\n\nIt is precisely due to such a method of warning that “keeping servants and concubines is fortunate,” because slaves or concubines understand the consequences of disloyalty to their master. However, this is ultimately not the way to govern the world, thus \"not suitable for great affairs.\""},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Enjoys retreat.

For the superior man, this means good fortune; for the inferior man, failure.\"\n\nExplanation of the line's meaning:\n\"Favorable\" indicates being advantageous. \"Failure\" (in Chinese, synonymous with \"blocked\") refers to the obstruction of the retreat path.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: When circumstances are favorable for withdrawing, the superior man can timely retreat and thus achieve good fortune. If it is the inferior man, he may miss the opportunity, resulting in the cessation of the retreat path.\n\nThe insight of this line for people is: When it is time to retreat, one should do so and seize the opportunity. From the hexagram image perspective, the yang line of the fourth place occupies a yin position and corresponds correctly with the first six. When yin is rising and yang is declining, the yang in the fourth place should retreat and change to yin. At this moment, one should perceive that the situation is unfavorable, make a courageous retreat, and return to the proper path.\n\nThe fourth line is located at the initial stage of the upper trigram Qian of the Dun hexagram. Qian stands for advancement and decisiveness. If the fourth line can refrain from clinging to personal desires to ascend further and timely return to the right path, good fortune can naturally be achieved. If one covets fame and profit, fails to recognize the right time to act, one might lose the opportunity for a proper retreat, thereby endangering oneself.\n\nThe commentary in \"The Image\" analyses this line: \"The superior man finds the retreat favorable, while the inferior man does not.\" It indicates that a superior man can retreat calmly when necessary, whereas the inferior man cannot achieve this.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in a divination, even if they have reluctance in their heart, it is already the right time to withdraw. To retire when it is time to do so is a sign of strong will, which only a superior man can accomplish. If one has a weak will, harbors reluctance, or feels humiliation and fear due to retreating, and delays too long, it will lead to disaster.\n\n\"Nine in the fourth place: Favorable is retreat. For the superior man, this means good fortune; for the inferior man, failure.\"\nThe text means: To retreat when it is time to do so brings good fortune for the superior man, while for the inferior man, it leads to obstruction.\nThe commentary means: The superior man can make a bold retreat in tumultuous conditions, while the inferior man cannot achieve this."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: Graceful retreat.

From the perspective of the hexagram, the Top Nine occupies the highest position in the Retreat hexagram and is within the upper trigram Qian, which represents Heaven. It can roam freely, implying soaring high and retreating far away, enjoying itself in the woods and mountains. Since the Top Nine is neither burdened nor constrained and has already distanced itself, akin to flying far away, there is nothing unfavorable regardless of actions taken. \n\nFor those who draw this line, if you can transcend material temptations and desires, separate your emotions from worldly matters, you can elegantly retreat without doubts or feelings of loss, and there will be more important matters awaiting you. Maintaining this state of mind will lead to greater rewards.\n\nTop Nine: Prosperous retreat, nothing is unfavorable. The image says: Prosperous retreat, all favorable; no doubts.\n\nThe text means: retreating swiftly like flying, with nothing unfavorable. The text means: swift retreat without disadvantages due to lack of hesitation. Retreating like flying, as swift and free as a bird, certainly has no unfavorable factors. This is how ancient hermits lived—they were very free, finding joy in nature. However, they still cared about national affairs. They could gain the attention and consultation of rulers, delve into the hardships of common people, offer advice to wise kings and receive rewards, or avoid wicked power-holders for self-preservation, maintaining silence and retreating for safety.

However, if one goes with the times and responds appropriately, prosperity is inevitable.\n\nGreat Image: \"Tun\" signifies difficulty, as everything is attempting to proceed but cannot advance.\n\nFortunes: Finding oneself in a predicament, progressing cautiously and strategically, with initial difficulties yielding eventually to resolution.\n\nCareer: Initially fraught with adversity, it's crucial to advance while recognizing difficulties, proceeding carefully, boldly, and flexibly. Great success is possible if opportunities are seized at the right time, though not hastily, as obstacles remain and assistance from others is essential. Hence, one should frequently offer favors in ordinary times.\n\nBusiness: At the start of an enterprise, the path is difficult with many setbacks. Firm belief is most important.

Qian symbolizes heaven, Kun symbolizes earth; Qian symbolizes the father, Kun symbolizes the mother, and so on. The hexagrams of Qian and Kun are referred to as the \"parental hexagrams,\" and the interaction between these two hexagrams gives rise to all things in the universe. TUN (Difficulty at the Beginning) as the third hexagram, symbolizes the beginning of things.\n\nIn the Sequence of Hexagrams, it is stated: \"What fills the space between heaven and earth are the myriad things, hence it is followed by TUN. TUN symbolizes fullness; it also represents the initial formation of things.\" What fills the space between heaven and earth are myriad things, so what appears next is the TUN hexagram. TUN signifies fullness, as well as the beginning of all things being born.\n\nThe TUN hexagram is an image of difficulty in progress, symbolizing the hardships at the initial stages, essentially \"the start of all things is difficult.\" In terms of the hexagram's imagery, this is because the upper hexagram is Kan, which represents danger and peril. The lower hexagram wants to move forward but is obstructed by Kan, hence one must progress with difficulty. This hexagram is considered one of the least auspicious in the hexagram cycle. The Commentary on the Image describes it: \"The wind blows the silk into disarray, obscuring its end; chaotic and confused, one falls into worry. Proceed slowly and carefully, aligning to smoothness, hasty rush only leads to constraint.\"\n\nThe upper hexagram of TUN is Kan, representing water, and the lower hexagram is Zhen, representing thunder, so the overall image of TUN is Water Thunder TUN. In other words, the combination of water and thunder is the symbolic meaning of TUN. Yet the word \"TUN\" denotes the image of a sprout, while the hexagram imagery is of water and thunder—what connection is there between them? It is that Kan is above, representing clouds, and Zhen is below, representing thunder; when dark clouds appear along with the sound of thunder, naturally it will rain. It is only with rain that plants on the ground can grow, and sprouts can have the hope of thriving. Thus, the hexagram name \"TUN\" cleverly and intricately aligns with the hexagram's imagery."},"line_1":{"description":"Initial Nine: Hesitation and delay.

When you start a new endeavor and feel uncertain, you can adjust your goals and strategies, consult experienced subordinates, and reward them. This not only provides them with certain benefits but also assigns them certain responsibilities and obligations, similar to enfeoffing feudal lords, which is beneficial to your endeavor.\n\nOne who receives this hexagram may find themselves in a predicament, hesitating and unable to realize their potential. At this time, it is not advisable to take action; instead, stay at home and maintain moral integrity. You should build your prestige and cultivate interpersonal relationships, or wait until you have achieved certain accomplishments before making a significant move. The beginning of an enterprise is challenging, making it hard to achieve results. However, if you uphold integrity and bravely advance, the future is bound to be beneficial.\n\nThe Image says: \"Though hesitating, the will is upright. To honor the humble, one gains great support from the people.\"\n\nThis phrase means that although you may hesitate, your intention to move forward is legitimate; being honorable while in a lowly position can broadly win the support of the people.\n\nThe first line advises not to be discouraged when facing difficulties but to have the intention to move forward. Additionally, pay attention to \"honoring the humble,\" meaning that a ruler should treat ministers well, and a leader should respect subordinates, paying respect to the wise and capable.\n\nOne who receives this hexagram may be nominated by many to do something or become a leader or small chief. Although you have this capability, the timing is unfavorable, making it difficult to fulfill your aspirations, which could be described as having grand ambitions yet unfulfilled.\n\nThe initial Yang line holds the position, just like an employee with great ambitions at a lower-level position. In the Zhouyi, Yang is noble and Yin humble, thus the initial Yang line is \"honoring the humble,\" coming to a low position with a noble identity. Today, we should not assume Yang simply represents male and Yin female. In fact, everyone with great ambitions is noble because their aspirations can make them noble. Such ambitious individuals in humble positions must be steadfast like rock and self-reliant like a monumental pillar; only by doing so can they achieve great success."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: Obstacles appear to be threatening as if a carriage is spinning around.

It takes ten years to marry, which is a reversal of the norm.\" This means that the difficulty for line six in this position comes from being seated above a firm line. It takes ten years before marriage is possible, and ultimately everything returns to normal.\n\nFrom this hexagram, we can understand the key points of choosing a partner: it is not about money, nor about status, but about whether the person is your intended one, whether he is ambitious and capable of development. Thus, this perceptive individual in line six of the second position marries her successful intended partner in the ninth horizontal line after ten years.

The third line of the lower trigram, which belongs to the Zhen trigram, represents action. The third line also falls within the Kun trigram, which signifies fields. From the position of the third line, we can infer that it involves hunting in the fields. The third line is a yin line, but it is located in the \"three\" position, which is a firm place, without a leader above. Therefore, this suggests that although one enters the field and forest, there is no one to follow, no one to command or guide. As one's nature is yin and lacks this ability, in such a situation, it is better to abandon the pursuit of prey; otherwise, difficulties may arise.\n\nFor those who encounter this line, it is essential to learn to act according to circumstance. If there is no competent assistant to help or support from leadership, and one is not skilled in this, it is best to give up and not proceed. If one is not talented in a particular field and forces oneself to achieve something in that area, not only will the effort fail, but it may also bring misfortune.\n\nIn \"The Symbolism,\" it is explained: \"The deer is pursued without a guide, and it follows the beasts. One of noble character abandons it. Pursuing further brings hardship and leads to exhaustion.\" This phrase means that chasing the deer without a hunting official's guidance, merely following the animals, is only for the pursuit of game. The noble person should give it up, and pursuing further will bring difficulties, even lead to distress.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, they must be cautious when taking action. Some things can be done when the timing, place, and harmony of people are right, and one has the ability to do so; it should be done without hesitation. Some things cannot be done, and one lacks the capability, even if a mountain of gold and silver is before you, you should not attempt it. If one is greedy for wealth and honor, ignoring one's abilities, disaster will inevitably occur. When facing such a situation, one should let go when necessary, control one's greed, and not just blindly chase the prey, ignoring one's circumstances.\n\nThe third line resides at the top of the Zhen trigram. Zhen represents action, but being at the very top, the third line inevitably exhibits excessive action. Moving further upward enters the Kan trigram, which signifies danger, indicating peril ahead. Therefore, the line's wording employs a highly vivid metaphor to offer a pertinent and candid warning. A noble person chases a deer into the forest but has entered unfamiliar territory, eager to obtain the deer. Due to this haste, the noble person did not bring an experienced hunting guide, thus facing the risk of losing one's way. What should be done: continue the chase or abandon it? A wise noble person chooses to give up."},"line_4":{"description":"Sixty-four.

A gentleman should abandon this pursuit; continuing it would lead to difficulties, even to the point of entrapment.\n\nThose who draw this line should pay attention when acting.

Otherwise, it denotes misfortune.\n\nThe commentary states: \"Accumulating its fat,\" indicating that the benevolence has not reached its full extent. This points out that those who only focus on hoarding wealth for themselves without caring to help others, even if they aspire to achieve something, their prospects will not be very bright.\n\nIf an ordinary person receives this hexagram, you must understand the principles of giving and taking. Focusing solely on accumulating wealth without helping others is very dangerous. Doing so might lead to some success in minor matters, but in major matters, it will certainly lead to misfortune.

The sun sinking into the earth implies the dimming of light and an unclear future with difficult circumstances.

Explanation of the line statement:\n\nLeft thigh: left upper leg. Rescue: to save. Strong horse: refers to a robust horse.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram symbols, the six in the second position belongs to a yin line located at a yielding position, gaining influence, and maintaining central alignment and correctness. The six in the second position has the characteristics of being gentle, yielding, and centered, which makes such a person more susceptible to bullying during dark times and thus getting hurt. However, because this line stays centered and correct, there will be people coming to assist, thus achieving good fortune.\n\nThe commentary in the Image section analyzes this line saying: The auspiciousness of the six in the second position is due to its compliance and adherence to principle. It points out that the six in the second line can achieve auspiciousness because it is compliant yet maintains principles.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, when circumstances further deteriorate, your activities will be constrained. At this time, if you have strong friends to help you, they can assist in alleviating your pressure.\n\nIn a workplace setting, you may encounter a situation where the supporting staff around you are harmed, and you should quickly supplement with strong personnel to resolve the crisis, just as when the left leg is injured, a strong horse should be used for rescue. Doing so allows one to escape danger and transform misfortune into good fortune.\n\nSix in the second position: Ming Yi, wounded in the left thigh, use a strong horse to rescue, auspicious.\n\nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the six in the second position is due to compliance and adherence to principle.\n\nThe meaning of the text is: Light enters the earth, the left thigh is injured, a strong horse rescues, auspicious. The image commentary means: The auspiciousness of the six in the second position lies in being compliant yet principled.\n\nThis is akin to a person walking a dark road and injuring their thigh as a result. However, having a strong horse, one is saved by the horse. Meeting danger but having rescue leads to ultimate auspiciousness. The six in the second position is the lower line of the mutual hexagram Kan within the Ming Yi hexagram. Kan represents a beautiful horse, a pulling horse, and also stands for danger, hence the line statement about encountering danger and being saved by a horse. Horses are extremely intuitive and human-like; in films, we often see scenes of how horses save their masters. With such a good horse, the owner will certainly be auspicious."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third position: When darkness comes during a southern hunt, capturing a great leader, there should be no haste; rectitude is necessary.  \nThe Image says: The intent of the southern hunt is indeed a great gain.","interpretation":"Nine in the third position: In the hunting grounds in the south, drawing the bow and shooting arrows, gaining some large wild beasts.

One must not be hasty; it is auspicious to be steadfast.\"\n\nExplanation of the line statement: \n\"Hunting\" refers to seeking out. \"Great leader\" refers to a chief or leader. \"Hasty\" implies urgency.\n\nIn terms of the hexagram, the third line is a yang line in a strong position, which is appropriate. Yang lines are characterized by activity and an upward momentum. Being at the end of the lower trigram with both movement and brightness in mind, action can be pursued.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image analyzes this line as: \"The ambition of hunting in the south leads to great success.\" Here, it indicates that the intent to campaign or patrol in the south will lead to considerable gains.\n\nThose drawing this line, though experiencing difficulties, can still achieve something meaningful, provided they do not act too hastily. Thus, actions will yield results.\n\nLine statement: \"Nine in the third place means: Light hides in the south while hunting, capturing the great leader. One must not be hasty; it is auspicious to be steadfast.\"\n\nThe Image states: \"The ambition of hunting in the south leads to great success.\"\n\nThe text implies: Light penetrates into the depths of the earth while hunting in the south, capturing the chief leader. Avoid haste, and maintain moral integrity. The imagery of hunting in the south suggests significant gains can be achieved.\n\nAs night falls and animals sleep soundly, capturing them becomes easier. Similarly, in a military context, a night raid can effectively defeat an enemy. The line statement describes such a successful night raid, not only defeating the enemy but also capturing their leader. However, due to the darkness, it is unwise to pursue the enemy relentlessly, hence \"one must not be hasty.\"\n\nThe reference to \"hunting in the south\" is primarily because the third line is the top line of the lower trigram Li in the Ming Yi hexagram. In King Wen's Eight Trigrams arrangement, Li represents the south."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth line: Entering the left side of the belly, obtaining the inner heart of the Bright Yi, and emerging from the gate courtyard.  \nThe Image says: Entering the left side of the belly signifies obtaining the intention.","interpretation":"Six in the fourth place: Return to a place of deep retreat!

With this insight, one resolutely steps out of the gate, leaving this place.\n\nFrom the hexagram's imagery, the six in the fourth position is a yin line in a soft position, located at the beginning of the upper trigram. The dimness of the Ming Yi hexagram is in the upper trigram, indicating that the six in the fourth position has already entered into the midst of the dimness.\n\nIn the Image, it is analyzed as: \"Entering into the left side of the abdomen,\" meaning understanding the intention. This suggests the six in the fourth position has already \"entered the left side of the abdomen,\" which allows one to deeply understand the situation of the obstructed brightness from the inside, grasping the thoughts and intentions of the dim ruler, then deciding to leave. This is akin to Weizi in the Shang Dynasty, who, after understanding King Zhou of Shang, departed the court. \n\nThose who draw this line find themselves trapped in a predicament and understand the reasons behind it: perhaps the leader is foolish, perhaps petty people are in power. At this point, one must resolve to leave the place of right and wrong. Of course, in such a dark time, one must still hold onto the light and uphold the right way, so that one can be understood and relied upon once again.\n\nSix in the fourth position: Entering into the left side of the abdomen, grasping the heart of Ming Yi, exiting from the courtyard.\n\nThe meaning of the text is: Entering the inner side of close ministers, gaining insight into the internal matters of harmed brightness, and exiting the courtyard. \n\nThe Image text means: By entering the inner side of close ministers, one can obtain the true thoughts of the ruler."},"line_5":{"description":"Six in the fifth place: The flight of Prince Ji signifies brightness injured; it is beneficial to be steadfast and correct.\nThe image says: The steadfastness of Prince Ji indicates that brilliance cannot be extinguished.","interpretation":"Nine in the fifth place: After the fall of the Yin Dynasty, Jizi fled to a neighboring country in the east to take refuge and received an auspicious omen through divination.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: Jizi's withdrawal and steadfastness in upholding righteousness ensured that his glorious image remains bright for a thousand ages.","scholar_interpretation":"Flat: Those who receive this line find it difficult to encounter a kindred spirit, or may face misfortune in the family.

As recounted in the chapter \"Yu Lao\" of Han Feizi: \"In the past, King Zhou made ivory chopsticks, and Ji Zi became fearful.\" King Zhou ordered a pair of ivory chopsticks, which others did not find concerning, but Ji Zi was alarmed when he learned of it. Ji Zi remarked: \"If one uses ivory chopsticks, they will surely refuse to use coarse bowls; then they will demand rhinoceros and jade goblets, rare delicacies, and luxuriously embroidered clothing, building grand and spacious palaces and towers. Things will become unmanageable.\" Indeed, King Zhou became increasingly extravagant and licentious. Ji Zi repeatedly remonstrated, but King Zhou would not heed him. Someone advised Ji Zi: \"This nation is beyond salvation, you should leave.\" Ji Zi replied: \"To remonstrate and, not being heard, then leave, is to expose the ruler's faults and exonerate oneself before the people; I cannot bear to do this.\" He believed that it was a minister's duty to admonish and guide the ruler against improper words and deeds. To abandon the ruler when unreceptive to counsel would be to highlight the ruler's vices and present oneself favorably to earn public favor; this was something he could not condone.\n\nHere, Ji Zi adhered to the principle of concealing faults and promoting virtues, a moral standard upheld by honorable men of ancient times. As a junzi, or noble person, one should not constantly stir up trouble or pander to the crowd. Ji Zi chose neither to leave nor to support King Zhou’s tyrannies but instead disguised himself as mad by letting his hair hang loose. Eventually, King Zhou demoted him to a house slave, and Ji Zi withdrew into seclusion at Mount Ji, where he would often play his zither and sing mournfully. Later generations recorded his songs, which were titled \"The Lament of Ji Zi.\"\n\nIn a dark, autocratic society, it was exceedingly difficult for a minister to neither participate in nor support the ruler's tyranny while also ensuring personal safety. In such a situation, Ji Zi chose to sacrifice material interests, power, and personal reputation while patiently waiting for the darkness to pass and the light to return. He finally saw that day when King Wu of Zhou defeated King Zhou and respectfully sought Ji Zi’s counsel. Ji Zi then transmitted the \"Nine Categories of Governance\" to King Wu as guidance for ruling a country.\n\nThe meaning of this line is that one should adopt Ji Zi’s approach of concealing one’s brilliance and wisdom. Such conduct is beneficial for maintaining the righteous path."},"line_6":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: The enlightenment of Ji Zi is beneficial for steadfastness.  \nThe Image says: The steadfastness of Ji Zi shows that enlightenment cannot be extinguished.","interpretation":"Sixty-five: After the fall of the Yin dynasty, Ji Zi fled to a neighboring country in the east to seek refuge and sought divination, receiving auspicious omens.

The meaning of this line statement is: without brightness, it is completely dark. Initially ascends to the sky, later it falls into the ground. The Top Six position is at the pinnacle of the entire hexagram, representing the darkest time. The fifth line along with the top line belongs to the heavenly position, where the sun should be shining in all directions. However, the person in the higher position is ignorant and does not uphold the right path, resulting in the brightness \"falling into the ground.\"\n\nThe \"Image\" explains this line as: \"Initially rises to the sky,\" illuminating the four corners of the nation; \"Later descends to the ground,\" losing the rules. Here it points out: \"Initially rising to the sky\" indicates that its brightness could illuminate all corners of various nations; \"Later descending to the ground\" means it has already lost its rightful influence due to straying from the right path, transforming from brightness to darkness.\n\nFor one who obtains this line, it signifies that in the group or unit they belong to, the leadership is ignorant, and the petty people hold power, immersing them in the darkness of Top Six: Not bright, dark; initially rises to the sky, later descends to the ground.\n\nThe text means: Not bright, dark. Initially ascends to the sky, later falls to the ground.\n\nThe image text means: Initially rising to the sky can illuminate all directions. Later falling to the ground means losing the law.\n\nTop Six is at the extreme of darkness, yet the darkest time is also the era when light is about to come. This is what is referred to as the darkness before dawn. Therefore, it illustrates the cycle and alternation of light and darkness to people. \"Initially rising to the sky\" describes the sunrise; \"Later descending to the ground\" describes the sunset. Thus, in the darkest moment, one should understand that brightness is about to arrive.\n\nThe image text further expands on the line statement, suggesting that the darkness caused by sunset is due to the loss of rules. In this context, the sunset no longer refers to the sunset we observe in the evening, but refers to a kind of political corruption of the Ming Yi hexagram, the sunset of civilized systems, symbolizing dark corruption."}},"26":{"general":{"description":"Great Accumulation.

This hexagram features dissimilar trigrams stacked upon one another, with Qián (Heaven) below and Gèn (Mountain) above. Qián represents the sky and strength; Gèn denotes the mountain and steadfastness. The term \"Xù\" signifies accumulation and has dual meanings: both storing and halting. Dà Xù implies immense accumulation.\n\nBoth the hexagram of Dà Xù and Xiǎo Xù convey the concept of nurturing and storing, but they differ in essence. Xiǎo Xù's hexagram illustrates restrained gathering of yang by singular yin, where yang prevails while yin diminishes, with one yin line supporting five yang lines. This symbolizes insufficient strength, necessitating temporary halting to accumulate power. It metaphorically refers to virtuous individuals living in turbulent times, who are unable to fulfill their potential, instead choosing passive withdrawal, cultivating virtue, and conserving knowledge to maintain personal integrity. Dà Xù, however, embodies different connotations, symbolizing significant nurturance and accumulation, akin to a great mountain encompassing all under the heavens. It alludes to the enlightened ruler of a thriving era fostering talents, utilizing them to accomplish grand undertakings.\n\nPositioned after the hexagram Wú Wàng, the \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" states: \"Only upon sincerity without falsehood can accumulation commence, hence comes Dà Xù.\" Sincerity stems from authenticity, fostering substance, thereby permitting considerable accumulation.\n\nThe commentary of \"Image\" explains this hexagram as: \"Heaven within the mountain, Dà Xù; a superior person should learn the words and conduct of former virtuous ones, to cultivate their virtue.\"\n\nThe \"Image\" asserts the hexagram's symbolism: Qián (Heaven) beneath Gèn (Mountain), depicting the heavens enclosed within a mountain, representing vast accumulation and nurturing. A noble person should emulate this spirit, endeavoring to absorb and comprehend the discourses and actions of ancient sages, thus enriching and cultivating admirable virtues and accumulating extensive knowledge. The hexagram Dà Xù reveals the principle of halting without complete cessation, being a mid-high level hexagram.

Initial Nine is a yang line in a firm position. It is prone to act, although virtues and talents have not yet been fully learned, there is an eagerness to proceed.

Wild boars have tusks and are very ferocious, posing a significant threat to humans.

By doing so, you can tame its strong and violent nature and make it docile, thus ensuring safety.\n\nSome very talented individuals are proud of their abilities and difficult to control due to their violent temper. The six in the fifth place occupies a royal position, representing the ruler of Da Xu, who desires to recruit such talented people for use. By employing a strategy of overcoming strength with gentleness, suppressing violence and arrogance, such individuals, who are like wild boars with long tusks, naturally transform and become tame imperceptibly.

Wild boars are extremely ferocious animals, hard for humans to tame. Thus, people devised a method to tie up the wild boar and then castrate it, after which the boar would become compliant. The ancients used this method to tame wild boars, turning them into domestic animals. Tamed wild boars, although still having tusks in their mouths, become gentle in temperament and therefore pose no harm to humans.\n\nIn the line statement of the hexagram Da Xu, it reflects the ancient practice of taming livestock, which was a crucial condition for humans to accumulate wealth. If ancient humans had not tamed animals, the means of production would not have been more abundantly stored, and property would not have been more greatly accumulated. The Book of Changes cites the ancients' deeds in taming animals for two main reasons: first, to remind future generations not to forget the achievements of their ancestors; and second, to let people understand that when cultivating human moral thoughts, they should draw lessons from the experience of taming animals."},"line_6":{"description":"Top Nine.

Qian represents heaven, associated with yang, positioned high above, spreading light over the world, bringing brightness and warmth to people. Li represents fire, positioned below, blazing with flames, also capable of bringing brightness and warmth to people. From this, it is evident that although the positions of the sun and fire are different, their functions are the same; they can be said to be like-minded, hence the name Tong Ren, \"Fellowship with Men.\"\n\nThe Image says: \"Heaven with fire, Fellowship with Men; the gentleman uses kinship to organize and discern things.\" This informs people that a gentleman should understand the principle that things gather by kind, people group accordingly, discerning things, seeking common ground while reserving differences, uniting people to govern the world.\n\nThe hexagram of Tong Ren symbolizes harmony between above and below, considered an upper-middle hexagram. The Image interprets this hexagram as: when one harbors doubts in the heart, plans from the past are not realized. Fortunately, one encounters a wise person for guidance, and all kinds of worries naturally dissipate."},"line_1":{"description":"Initial Nine: Fellowship with men at the gate.

This line is a yang line situated in a firm position, upright and gaining influence. It repels the \"Fourth Nine\" due to their opposing natures; they are not in resonance. However, this also symbolizes that no private relationships exist between them, emphasizing fairness and broadness in interactions. Hence, it is said to associate with others outside the gate. Although it hasn't reached the \"wilderness\" level of unity described in the hexagram text, it has already surpassed the limited confines of close family relations. Such broad interaction will naturally not lead to faults.\n\nIf you act with fairness, without bias or protecting faults, then you will find like-minded individuals to jointly establish ventures. Going out of the house to meet like-minded people, how could there be any fault in that? When encountering problems, seeking others' help outside, how could that be wrong? Leaving home, stepping out of one's small circle, and going among the populace, how could there be any error? This describes \"associating harmoniously at the gate, without fault.\" In ancient China, whenever there was a significant matter that the ruler could not resolve, a public notice would be posted to invite capable individuals from across the land to address it.\n\nThese notices were typically posted outside the midday gate or city gate to ensure more people could see them. This is the essence of \"associating at the gate.\" Therefore, \"associating at the gate\" carries the meaning of inviting the assistance of virtuous individuals from all over, as well as blending in with the common people. Accomplishing these things will certainly result in no faults."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: Gathering with others at the ancestral temple, distress.\n\nThe Image says: Gathering with others at the ancestral temple, the way leads to distress.","interpretation":"Line Two: Gather the clan at the ancestral temple, divining and praying about fortune and misfortune, because they are facing difficulties.

However, in the Tong Ren gua (Hexagram of Fellowship), this correspondence indicates private affections and personal interests. This hexagram aims to promote an ideal world of universal harmony, necessitating impartial and selfless interactions. Thus, the correspondence between the second and fifth lines becomes an unfavorable relationship, hence unsuitable. It is akin to socializing only within a clan or among surnames, reflecting a selfish mindset. Such a clan-focused and inward-looking attitude, although not wrong, is not commendable. This line suggests that one should break the mindset of clan exclusivity and broaden one's circle of friends and connections. Solely bonding with one's clan members will lead to difficulties, and endeavors will naturally be challenging. One should have a longer-term perspective and engage more with the outside world.\n\nThe Xiang commentary states: \"Fellowship with men in a clan,\" refers to a path of narrow-mindedness, cautioning that the inability to unite people across various levels is the root of troubles. Thus, if you wish to achieve something, do not solely rely on those within your clan. Particularly, family-run businesses and ventures must handle interests carefully to avoid mutual suspicion, which can harm familial bonds.\n\nBreaking these boundaries and uniting people from all walks of life will be more beneficial to one's endeavors."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: Lying in ambush in the grass, ascending to their high mound, there will be no rising for three years.  \nThe Image: Lying in ambush in the grass means the enemy is strong.

","philosophy":"Nine in the third place: Troops are hidden in the underbrush, ascend the high hill, and do not advance for three years.\n\nExplanation of the Text:\n\"Hidden\" refers to ambush or lying in wait, wanting to fight but not taking action. \"Troops\" refers to soldiers. \"Underbrush\" represents wilderness, thickets, or jungles. \"Ascend\" means to climb. \"Hill\" refers to a mound or hillock.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: The army is hidden among dense forests and thickets, occupying the nearby strategic high ground as a lookout, and for three years, they dare not recklessly engage in warfare.\n\nWhen considering the relationship of this line with other lines, it can be illustrated as follows: Six in the second place is a yin line representing a woman, while nine in the third place is a yang line in a yang position, at the uppermost of the lower trigram, representing a man. Within the entire hexagram, the most powerful is nine in the fifth place, also a yang line in a yang position, at the position of the ruler, representing a man stronger than nine in the third place. Nine in the third place is a leader of a small nation, and a stronger foreign leader admires a beautiful woman within nine in the third place's territory. To please the stronger leader, nine in the third place intends to send the beauty for a political marriage. However, nine in the third place himself desires the beauty and forcibly marries her. He worries that the other leader might invade out of anger, and since he is not a match for the stronger leader, the situation described in the line occurs, where troops hide in the forests, constantly vigilant. Fortunately, the allied nation does not invade, avoiding disaster.\n\nFor those who receive this line, they should pay attention to maintaining external relationships and not create tensions with allies due to selfish desires, which would exhaust effort and bring fear and unease.\n\nHiding troops among the underbrush for three years without daring to engage the enemy directly is truly cautious. However, caution prevents major mistakes. Although living in the underbrush is tough, it allows for preserving strength. This could still refer to the historical event of Emperor Gaozong's campaign against the Gui Fang. The Gui Fang was an ancient tribe in the northwest of China. Traditionally, the northern peoples of China were known for their bravery and combativeness, so Emperor Gaozong's campaign likely faced setbacks initially. With an overpowering enemy, what can be done? Only wait for the opportunity. Hide troops among the underbrush, study new military strategies, and look for an opportunity to decisively defeat the enemy. \"Three years not advancing\" essentially means taking action after three years. That means after three years, the enemy was defeated. This is the strategic and tactical approach necessary when facing a formidable enemy."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: He climbs his wall, but he cannot attack it successfully; this is auspicious.\n\nThe Image says: Climbing his wall signifies that it is not appropriate to attack.

","philosophy":"Fourth line of the Tong Ren hexagram, the line statement: Nine in the fourth: Ascend the ramparts, but unable to attack, auspicious.\n\nFor those who receive this line, it is important to understand the need for timely abandonment. Just like climbing the city walls preparing to battle the enemy but choosing to give up, this results in auspicious outcomes.\n\nThe Commentary says: \"Ascend the ramparts,\" signifies an inability to attack. The \"auspiciousness\" comes from realizing the inappropriateness of the attack and refraining from it.

This resembles one who adheres to the path of rectitude and correctness, thus necessarily turning misfortune into fortune. The joining of the large forces signifies that our army has overwhelmed the enemy.","scholar_interpretation":"Peace: For those who obtain this line, difficulties come first, followed by ease, and matters of right and wrong are not consistent.

The army encounters like-minded individuals, eventually achieving victory in battle, hence the laughter.\n\nWhen seeking like-minded people, there will inevitably be some resistance; it's not easy to find them. You may have experienced deep sorrow because of this. However, as long as you do not give up and overcome these obstacles, you will ultimately achieve your goal and smile.\n\nFor those who receive this line, when negotiations with partners have reached a stalemate, a third party may unexpectedly emerge, turning the situation to your advantage.

It is a yang line in a yin position, representing a lack of proper placement and influence. It opposes the third nine and is distant from the second six, with a multitude of yang lines in between. Forcing a connection with the second six would excessively drain one's energy and lead to conflict. Therefore, it's unnecessary to strive for the optimal state; it is better to make connections with people nearby who are in the \"suburbs\" and live peacefully without disputes.\n\nThe image signifies: \"Fellowship with men in the suburbs,\" indicating an unachieved ambition. It suggests gathering people outside the urban area, which clearly falls short of one's initial aspirations.\n\nFor those who receive this line in a divination, if you wish to accomplish something or connect with important or like-minded individuals, but find too many people vying for those connections and face internal struggles with no chance for networking, it's better to connect with those who are easier to reach.\n\nThe upper nine is on the periphery of the Qian Hexagram, with Qian symbolizing the wilderness. Therefore, this text includes the phrase \"fellowship with men in the suburbs,\" implying that in any society, there are unfulfilled individuals. Those with abilities but without recognition can only live reclusively in simplicity; such a person can be called a hermit. The upper nine represents a hermit who, though unfulfilled, can find contentment residing in a remote suburb alongside other hermits. By maintaining a humble existence without excessive desires, regret is avoided. This is akin to Zhuge Liang's advice to his nephew: \"One ought to have high aspirations, admire sages, break free from desires, and abandon stagnation, so that the spirit of ideals can rise visibly and be deeply felt; endure flexibility and eliminate trivialities, seek broad counsel, avoid idleness and stinginess, so even with prolonged flow, what harm is there to beauty, what worry of inadequacy?\" If one can achieve this in simplicity, one will naturally have the capacity to advance when necessary or maintain one's position otherwise."}},"35":{"general":{"description":"Jin.

The Jin hexagram is composed of different trigrams superimposed, with the upper trigram being Li and the lower trigram being Kun. Li represents the sun and brightness; Kun represents the earth. The sun is high above, illuminating the vast earth, which is humble and nurturing, allowing all things to grow with clarity and straightforwardness. This signifies the flourishing of one's career. The Jin hexagram follows the Da Zhuang hexagram. The Sequence of Hexagrams states, \"Things cannot remain in a state of great strength eternally, hence follows the Jin, which means advancement.\" The Da Zhuang hexagram implies \"stop,\" while now it is time for progress. The Miscellaneous Hexagrams say, \"Jin, it is day,\" with the imagery of \"brightness emerging above the earth,\" resembling the daylight suited for activity.\n\nIn Xiang's interpretation, \"brightness emerges above the earth, Jin; thus the gentleman manifests his radiant virtue.\" This indicates that sunlight rising from the ground symbolizes advancement and prosperity, signifying the expression of one's light and warmth. Therefore, a gentleman should fully display his talents and virtues, realizing his role. The inspiration provided by the Jin hexagram is to strive for advancement; it belongs to a moderately superior hexagram. Xiang comments on this hexagram: \"Weed out the grass among the seedlings, and unexpectedly wealth finds you, striking silver with every hoe, such fortune is considered good.\"\n\nThe hexagram is named Jin. The Shuowen Jiezi states, \"Jin means advancing. With the sunrise, all things advance,\" meaning all things progress and grow with the sun. An old saying goes \"all things grow relying on the sun,\" which refers to this meaning. When the sun rises, plants start to grow upward, reaching greater heights. Comparing the sun to a king implies that people receive the blessings of the king hence achieving accomplishments. Of course, the greatest grace given by the king to the subjects is promotion, so Jin also implies elevation in rank. The Sequence of Hexagrams states, \"Things cannot always remain in a state of great strength, thus they are succeeded by Jin, which means advancement.\" This means that phenomena cannot remain in a state of vigor indefinitely; after strength, there will be advancement and development, so following the Da Zhuang hexagram is the Jin hexagram.\n\nThe Jin hexagram diagram consists of two yang lines intersecting four yin lines. From the trigrams perspective, the upper trigram of the Jin hexagram is Li, representing the sun and brightness, while the lower trigram is Kun, representing the earth and submissiveness. Thus, the sun rising from the eastern earth is the image of the Jin hexagram. The rising sun in the east embodies the great imagery of ascent, a daily sight. A wise king rewards his meritorious subjects, so the promotion of the subjects is also an image of ascent."},"line_1":{"description":"First line: Advancing like being crushed, perseverance brings good fortune.

Although trust is not yet established, one should be magnanimous and face difficulties calmly, resulting in no harm.\n\nIn terms of the hexagram structure, the initial six is a yin line in a yang position, indicating a lack of proper positioning. Despite the desire to advance, there are setbacks. This is like newly graduated young people entering society without earning others' trust. In such situations, despite setbacks, one should not give up. Even without trust, without being petty, by humbly learning from others and improving oneself with a generous heart, there will naturally be no fault.\n\nThe \"Image\" commentary explains this line: \"Advancement like being crushed\"; it suggests acting alone with integrity. \"Magnanimity brings no fault\" because no authority, responsibility, or mission has been assigned yet. This points out that encountering obstacles and resistance at the outset requires perseverance according to one's principles to achieve auspicious results. Acting freely won't lead to mistakes because no authority or responsibility has been conferred.\n\nFor those consulting this line, it advises understanding your situation, knowing when to advance and when to retreat. While things may progress slowly and you may feel isolated, maintaining integrity will ultimately earn others' trust and respect.\n\nInitial Six: Advancement like being crushed, uprightness brings good fortune. Mutual trust is lacking, but with magnanimity, there is no fault.\n\nThe Image Commentary: Advancement like being crushed; act alone with integrity. Magnanimity brings no fault; no authority or mission has been assigned.\n\nThe text's meaning is: Seeking advancement but facing resistance, maintaining integrity brings fortune. Lack of trust and keeping an open heart leads to no difficulties. \n\nExplanation of the Image: Seeking advancement but facing resistance is due to the integrity of your path. Keeping an open heart brings no disaster because no appointment has been made yet.\n\nIn the lower trigram of Hexagram Jin, the three yin lines all desire to progress upward, similar to the struggles for power in officialdom. Although the initial six is at the bottom, it corresponds to nine-four, making it akin to a favored subordinate in the eyes of leadership. Such individuals are often those most easily marginalized in bureaucratic circles. So, what to do? As the saying goes, \"One must bow under low eaves,\" suggesting that patience is the best policy.

Great blessings are received from the Queen Mother.  \n\nExplanation of the Line Statement:  \n\n\"Worry\" refers to concern. \"Zhi\" is synonymous with \"this.\" \"Jie,\" as mentioned in the Book of Poems: \"To listen to the gods and receive great blessings,\" here refers to greatness. The \"Queen Mother\" refers to the fifth line, which is the sovereign's position; the yin line in the sovereign's position is thus called the \"Queen Mother.\"\nThe meaning of this line statement is: In the process of advancement, although one may feel troubled due to encountering setbacks, if one remains steadfast in the right path, good fortune will come, ultimately receiving great blessings bestowed by the Queen Mother of the fifth line.  \n\nFrom the hexagram's image, the second line is a yin line in a yielding position, situated in the central position of the lower trigram, obtaining balance and correctness, which embodies the virtue of centrality, correctness, and gentleness. This gains the appreciation of the ruler, the fifth line, allowing one to receive grace and blessings.  \n\nIn the commentary, it is explained as: \"To receive great blessings,\" is due to maintaining centrality and correctness. This highlights that the reason one can \"receive exceptional grace and blessings\" is because of their central position and actions in line with their role and the right path.  \n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, the path of progress may not be smooth, and they may feel anxious about it. However, one should not lose hope or give up. By maintaining humility and gentleness, continuing to advance, and patiently persevering, one's persistent efforts will eventually gain benevolent support and reward.  \n\nSix in the second position: Advancing yet worried, perseverance brings good fortune.  \nReceiving such great blessings is from the Queen Mother.  \n\nThe image says: Receiving great blessings is due to maintaining centrality and correctness.  \n\nThe text's meaning is: Advancement brings worries; upholding the right path leads to good fortune. Such great blessings are received from the Queen Mother. The image's meaning is: Receiving such blessings is because the second line maintains centrality and appropriateness.  \n\nThe second line, while having a certain status in the bureaucracy, is nonetheless worried. Why? Because it is adversarial and unresponsive to the fifth line and closely adjacent to the upper inner trigram Kan, which represents danger and many worries. Thus, the second line is always full of concerns, like standing on the brink of danger. Precisely because of this, the second line is cautious in its actions and avoids disasters. The second line holds its position and maintains central virtue, so even though it is repelled by the fifth line due to their same hexagram lines, it can still receive commendation from the fifth line. This is the meaning of \"Receiving such great blessings from the Queen Mother.\""},"line_3":{"description":"Six in the third place: The multitude is in accord.

From an image perspective, the six in the third position belongs to a yin line residing in a yang position, which would typically result in regret due to being out of place. However, because the six in the third position is at the top of the lower trigram Kun, it embodies a humble and compliant virtue. Furthermore, the two lines below are also yin lines, representing a foundation among the people, gaining their trust, and therefore, regret disappears. This hexagram emphasizes that if one wishes to advance or develop, it is essential to have a foundation among the people and to deeply win their hearts. Only in this way can one gain the trust and important appointments from superiors.\n\nThe \"Image\" section explains this line as: \"The aspiration of the people's approval is to strive upward.\" It points out that the aspiration to \"gain the people's approval\" is an effort to progress forward.\n\nThose receiving this line in a divination should focus on gaining recognition and trust from subordinates or those around them rather than solely trying to please superiors. Because once you gain the people's trust, you can continue striving towards established goals, and supported actions will more easily inspire your courage and confidence, which, in turn, can earn the appreciation of leaders or superiors, thus achieving your desires.\n\nSix in the third position: The multitude agrees, regrets vanish.\nThe Image says: The people's approval indicates aspiration moving upward.\n\nThe text means: With the momentum of the people's support, there is upward ascension without regret. The imagery suggests that being trusted by the people is because one's aspirations are progressive. \n\nBelow the third line are two yin lines that correspond with the upper nine, causing regret to disappear. They all have an upward trend, so the six in the third position can also utilize the strength from below to rise upward. Additionally, the six in the third position harmonizes with the nine in the fourth position and responds to the upper nine, so his ascent will be smooth. For example, six in the third position is like a manager in a unit where everyone below desires promotion, but due to the favor from higher-ups, when subordinates reach his position, he naturally gets promoted to a higher leadership role. Such a seamless advancement could hardly lead to regret."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Advancing like a squirrel.

Interpretation of the line text: \n\nThe flying squirrel, also known as the wing rat, is described in the Shuowen dictionary as a creature that \"can fly but cannot pass over the roof, can climb but cannot reach the top of the tree, can swim but cannot cross the valley, can dig but cannot hide itself, can run but cannot get ahead of people.\" This situation of \"five skills but ultimately limited\" is used to describe being greedy without achievement. \n\nThe meaning of this line text is that the desire to advance is like that of the flying squirrel: greedy but lacking skill. Even if one can strictly adhere to one's duties, disaster is unavoidable. The nine-in-the-fourth place is a yin line in a strong position but is not in the correct position. Below, there are three yin lines approaching, leaving no room to advance, thus falling into difficulty. In the Image text, it is analyzed as \"the flying squirrel is in danger, not positioned correctly.\" It points out that the reason for being \"like a flying squirrel, even being able to adhere to duties cannot avoid disaster\" is because of its incorrect position.\n\nFor those who encounter this line, your current situation might be unfavorable, with no path forward. You are always cautious, like a mouse scurrying around. At this moment, if you want to achieve something, do not be like the flying squirrel, greedy with no achievements. Instead, focus on mastering a skill, making it your expertise, which will be beneficial for your development. \n\nFor those who encounter this line, you might have gained a promotion or development, but due to improper methods, the situation becomes severe. You must go through arduous trials to avert danger.\n\nNine in the fourth place: Advancing like a flying squirrel. Integrity and danger. \n\nThe Image text states that the flying squirrel is in danger because the position is incorrect. Six in the fifth place is surrounded by numerous yin lines and falls into the upper separated hexagram of Kan, and is also the top line of the lower separated hexagram. The strong line resides in an even position, which is not correct, thus nine in the fourth place is in a dangerous situation and cannot extricate itself. The line text uses the flying squirrel as a metaphor for the nine in the fourth place, indicating one who can fly but not far, climb but not reach the top, swim but not cross the river, only swimming in small puddles; can dig but cannot create a hiding hole, busy with legs but not able to cover a distance even someone takes in one step. Such people know a bit of everything but have no expertise, which is quite common in society, and their fate may be like the \"flying squirrel,\" even adhering to their duties, they will not escape danger."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: Regret vanishes.

Worry refers to anxiety or concerns. \nThe meaning of this line statement is: regret disappears. There is no need to worry about loss or gain; proceed with good fortune, and everything will become smooth.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, six in the fifth position is a yin line residing in a strong position, at the highest position of the ruler. However, it is surrounded by yang lines both above and below. Although the six in the fifth position is inherently weak and gentle, it is capable of treating the firm yang officials with humility, maintaining balance without being extreme, and effectively controlling various forces around it, making the situation very favorable.\n\nThe Image explains this line as \"do not worry about loss or gain,\" indicating there will be celebration in advancing. Here it points out: \"there is no need to consider gains and losses,\" for as long as one continues to strive and persevere, auspicious fortune and celebration are inevitable.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, as long as you walk upright and behave correctly, there is no need to worry about temporary gains and losses.

The meaning of the Image is: without calculating gains and losses, there will be joyous events in advancing.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"if you do not let go, how can you gain?\" It's like the story of Sai Weng losing his horse, which led to gaining many horses. If Sai Weng had tied his horse securely, how could it have returned with a herd?

The meaning of the line statement is: Advancement or development has reached its peak, akin to reaching the tip of a beast's horn. At this time, one can campaign against a subordinate state, and though there is danger, there will be no calamity. If you remain unchanged, trouble will arise. From the hexagram image, the top nine is a yang line in a yielding position, which is out of place. The top nine is in the final position of the whole hexagram, symbolizing that advancement or development has reached its highest point with no path forward. At this point, one can stabilize internally; if no action is taken, there will be difficulties.\n\nIn the Image, this line is interpreted as: \"Use it to conquer a city,\" because the path has not been fully illuminated. Here it points out that \"campaign against a subordinate state\" indicates that the prosperity of the advance has reached its zenith, making further development difficult. For those who obtain this line, it means your progress or development has reached its peak, and pushing further is meaningless. You need to revise and change your strategy, and examine any internal issues. If problems are identified, efforts should be made to eliminate them. Although this may lead to misunderstanding and danger, failure to act will bring more trouble.\n\nTop nine: Jin at its peak, use it to conquer a city, danger brings fortune, no blame, holding to correctness leads to distress. The Image says: \"Use it to conquer a city,\" because the path has not been fully illuminated.\n\nThe text means: Advancement has reached its peak, and only by campaigning against small states can merit be established. In danger there is fortune, no calamity, but adhering to correctness will lead to difficulty. The Image explanation means: Only by campaigning against small states can merit be established, indicating that the path of advancement of the top nine still cannot be fully illuminated.\n\nAdvancement has reached its extremity, resulting in the loss of authority. Ancient advancement differs from modern times. Nowadays, promotion generally means increasing power. However, in ancient times, reaching the top meant becoming a Grand Emperor, so in name one was amongst the most important figures, even the Emperors feared a little, yet practically without any real power. This top nine seeks fame and status, so to continue enhancing his honor, he can only campaign against some small states. Since the top nine is at the end of the road, he will soon be pushed aside by the many yin lines, so stubbornly adhering to the correct path will lead to distressful matters arising."}},"51":{"general":{"description":"Shock.

In the I Ching, the symbol for the Gen hexagram is two broken lines below a solid line. This symbol originates from the ancient observation that mountains are made of stones of varying sizes. Therefore, two broken lines, or \"yin\" lines, represent the unevenly sized stones on a high mountain. From bottom to top, the highest layer is depicted as an undulating mountain peak, drawn with a single solid \"yang\" line, thus forming the symbol of the mountain.\n\nThe form of the \"Gen\" hexagram has a yang line situated above two yin lines, resembling the top of a mountain being yang, under which yin elements lie hidden. Since mountains are always still and unmoving, the nature of \"Gen\" is to \"stop.\" The symbolic meanings it represents include prohibition, obstruction, stillness, boundary, composure, calmness, alternation, stubbornness, subjectivity, new beginnings, standard, independence, transformation, litigation, sincerity, extinction, exhortation, waiting, and weightiness.\n\nThe lesson imparted by the Gen hexagram is that movement and stillness should be timely.

Thus, at this time, it is necessary to slow the speed of the cart and dampen the fox's tail to swim slower; the primary task is to decelerate.\n\nThe \"Image\" explains it thus: \"Dragging its wheel,\" signifies no blame. It points out: \"Dragging the wheel of the cart to prevent it from advancing swiftly,\" shows that after achieving success, one must act cautiously and be on guard to avoid disaster. At this time, recovery and consolidation are paramount, and rash actions are inadvisable; thus, there will be no blame.\n\nFor those who draw this line, whatever task you are engaged in has already shown initial success, and you should slow down, avoiding rushing forward at high speed, or there will be faults.\n\nInitial Nine: Dragging its wheel, dampening its tail, there is no blame.\nThe image says: \"Dragging its wheel,\" means that in principle, there will be no disaster."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place.

The meaning of this line statement is that Gaozong Wuding of Yin attacked the Guifang nation in the northwest and only after three years of continuous battles did he achieve victory. The victory was hard-won, so one should not employ selfish and reckless individuals in governance, otherwise, the stress on the people and wastage of resources may lead to internal turmoil.\n\nFrom the perspective of hexagram imagery, the nine in the third position is a yang line in a firm place, situated at the top of the lower trigram, indicating impatience and recklessness, and it opposes the nine in the fifth position, thus inevitably provoking the ruler’s attack.

The commentary in the I Ching (Book of Changes) explains: \"Defeated in three years\" signifies exhaustion. It indicates that after three years of continuous warfare, the kingdom of Guifang was finally defeated. This suggests that the war was intense and lasted for three years, with both sides utterly exhausted. The victory was hard-won. At this time, if governance were to be implemented in this area, it would not be appropriate to appoint someone like the Nine in the Third Place, who is greedy for success and rash.

The Nine in the Fifth Place is at the pinnacle of Li, symbolizing a career shining like the midday sun, which easily fosters arrogance and extravagance. Although they sacrifice cattle, there is insufficient piety and reverence. The Six in the Second Place, however, maintains its position in the center, acting with caution and prudence, and thus can achieve great things. The commentary explains this line: \"The eastern neighbor sacrifices cattle\" but is not as timely as the western neighbor; \"truly receives the blessing,\" great fortune comes. It indicates that \"the eastern neighbor sacrifices cattle and sheep for grand ceremonies,\" yet they are not as heartfelt and simple as the western neighbor's ceremonies; the western neighbor \"truly enjoys the blessings bestowed by the spirits,\" signifying that this is appropriate and auspicious fortune will continuously arrive.

The lower trigram is Qian, and the upper trigram is Zhen. Zhen represents thunder, and Qian represents heaven. Thunder in the sky, clouds and thunder rolling, with a grand and majestic momentum, flourishing yang energy, all things grow, strong and vigorous, hence it is called \"Strength.\" Being not only great but also strong, it is named \"Great Strength.\"\n\nThe hexagram's name is Great Strength. In the ancient text Shuowen Jiezi, it says, \"Strength, means great.\" In ancient times, a man in his thirties was called youth. Evidently, \"strength\" means greatness and robustness. The philosophical concept of this hexagram relates to the withdrawal and self-preservation, akin to a recluse who lives in the mountains, accumulating his abilities, and after continuous accumulation, finally becoming powerful. Thus, the Daxuan Hexagram comes after this self-preservation. It is like Dong Zhongshu, who diligently studied the sage's books for years and finally achieved scholarly success, integrating various philosophical thoughts. This aligns with the Hexagram Sequence's saying: \"Things cannot end in withdrawal; therefore, followed by Great Strength.\" However, Great Strength Hexagram does not imply advancement, but rather that through \"withdrawal,\" one has accumulated maximum strength, ready for action.\n\nGreat Strength Hexagram Line Configuration: The configuration of this hexagram is four yang lines below, two yin lines above, precisely the opposite arrangement of the Withdrawal Hexagram.\n\nGreat Strength Hexagram Image Analysis: Analyzing from the hexagram's image, the yang lines below symbolize the flourishing of yang energy, while the yin lines above symbolize the weakening of yin energy. Great Strength Hexagram is one of the twelve calendar hexagrams, representing the solar term Vernal Equinox. The six lines of Great Strength correspond to the thirty-odd days from Awakening of Insects to Clear Brightness. Five days constitute one division, with one line representing one division. During this period, all things begin to move, vegetation grows, animals start to reproduce, and by this time, the Awakening of Insects has passed, there begins to be thunder in the sky, presenting a grand spectacle on earth.

Sincerity: implies both confidence and the ability to act effectively.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: Strength in the toes, advancing will bring misfortune. Yet, there is sincerity.\n\nThe first line of the hexagram Da Zhuang is very similar to the initial nine \"Hidden dragon, do not act\" from the Qian hexagram. The initial nine marks the beginning of Da Zhuang's strength; the yang energy is robust and has just reached the toes. If the yang energy has not yet accumulated but hastens upwards, it is an impulsive action, bound to be dangerous. At this juncture, one must maintain integrity and accumulate strength, only moving forward when one has secured a stable footing and established a foundation.\n\nThe initial nine is a yang line in a strong position, gaining strength, with characteristics of vigorous action and advancement. This yang energy can propel one upward, instilling both confidence and the capability to act. However, from the hexagram image, the initial nine lacks a proper response above. Continuing upward will lead into the Guai hexagram, paradoxically forcing the yang lines into a predicament where excessive strength turns to decline. Therefore, one should accumulate and prepare, avoiding rash actions.\n\nInitial Nine: Strong in the toes, advancing will bring misfortune, but there is sincerity.\n\nThe image says: Strong in the toes, sincerity is limited.\n\nThe text implies: Strong in the toes, advancing brings danger, but there is sincerity.\n\nThe image interpretation suggests strength in the feet; sincerity will encounter limitations.\n\nThe initial nine is simply strong in the toes, leading to the belief that one's strength can conquer all, resulting in danger. This line warns people that when one's strength has accumulated, one should not assume complete strength. A clear understanding of oneself and the current situation is necessary. If one believes they are very strong and can conquer others, it only leads to danger. The initial nine's strength is limited, not yet accumulated enough to conquer others."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: Persistence brings good fortune.\n\nThe commentary says: The persistence and good fortune of nine in the second place is because it is situated in the central position of the lower trigram, symbolizing a person who adheres to the path of moderation and correctness.","interpretation":"Nine in the second place: The oracle brings auspicious signs.  \nThe \"Image\" says:","scholar_interpretation":"Fortunate: Those who receive this line will have successful plans.

Explanation of the line statement: The meaning of this line is that by adhering to the correct path, one can obtain good fortune. From the perspective of the hexagram image, the nine in the second position is a yang line occupying a yin position, which is a misplaced position. It possesses the cautious and gentle characteristics of a yin line, and will not rush forward impetuously. The impetuous ambition is slightly restrained. The nine in the second position is situated in the middle of the lower trigram and has a proper correspondence with the six in the fifth position above. Positioned in the middle and following the middle path, it can achieve good fortune.\n\nIn the \"Image\" section, this line is analyzed as follows: the nine in the second position's phrase “constancy leads to good fortune” is due to its central position. Here it is pointed out that the reason why the position of the nine in the second position can adhere to the right path and achieve good fortune is because it maintains a central position and can emerge with gentleness.\n\nIf you obtain this line, the current situation is very favorable to you. However, you should be careful not to become greedy for success and rush forward. Proceed cautiously and advance gradually. Even though the nine in the second position is within the lower trigram of Qian, in the entire hexagram Da Zhuang, it is still advisable to hold back. So at this time, it's beneficial to organize internally, adjust your strength, and advance steadily. Do not think of taking the advantage of favorable circumstances to speed up or expand excessively.\n\nThe nine in the second position is a yang line in an even position, which is not appropriate for its position. However, it is in the lower trigram and can uphold the doctrine of the mean, and it has the support of the six in the fifth position. Therefore, as long as it adheres to the correct path, it will be auspicious. This implies that the nine in the second position can accumulate its strength in stability without acting recklessly.

Using non-action (wu) is synonymous with having nothing, seeing everything as if it were nothing. Butting into a fence means using the horns of a sheep to push against the fence. Entangling means becoming entwined.\n\nThe meaning of this judgment is that petty people rely on strength and desire to win, while superior people do not act this way. Even if someone who is strong and competitive can maintain their vigorous strength, the outcome will not bring good results. It is like a strong ram butting into a fence, only to get its horns stuck and unable to break free.\n\nHexagram Da Zhuang, Line Three, Judgment: Nine in the third position: The petty person uses strength, the superior person uses non-action; persistence leads to danger, like a ram butting into a fence, entangling its horns.\n\nLife Lessons: From the hexagram image, the third nine belongs to a yang line in a strong position and is situated at the top of the Qian Hexagram, corresponding with the upper six, symbolizing looking up towards heaven in arrogance and seeing nothing else. In a time of great strength, being overly self-confident and lacking self-control can lead to trouble.\n\nPeople often make the mistake of relying on their own strengths while belittling others, or even harming others, such as through arrogant pride in their talents or by overpowering the weak. This hexagram, Da Zhuang, strongly advises against arrogance in strength and bullying the weak. Strong individuals, particularly, must exercise restraint and maintain self-control.\n\nThose who find this line in divination and encounter obstacles must understand that employing wisdom is crucial. Relying solely on brute force and blind courage will leave you exhausted and without any gains, further entangling you in trouble from which it is hard to escape.\n\nNine in the third position: The petty person uses strength, the superior person uses non-action, persistence leads to peril.

It combines the firmness of a yang line with the modesty and flexibility of a yin position. Positioned close to the ruler's weak Six in the fifth place, the strength of the nine in the fourth supports the weaker fifth. This support of weakness through strength is righteous, resulting in good fortune. Aiding the weak with strength allows for unhindered progress, akin to a large sheep being unrestricted by fences. The fourth and fifth lines advance in harmony, illustrating how a strong minister supports a weak ruler, ultimately leading to the realization of power and strength.\n\nThe commentary elaborates: \"The fence is breached, not weak,\" encouraging progress and advancement. The internal meaning is that a gentleman should act vigorously, moving forward assertively.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram: Once you find a proper channel for your strength, combining power and wisdom, even the greatest challenges can be overcome. You will transcend obstacles and proceed with ease.\n\nThose who receive this line: Exercise caution if you're driving or riding in a vehicle, paying attention to potential issues with the wheels or tires, and be mindful of your speed, especially when crossing roads.\n\nThe text states: \"Being righteous brings good fortune and dispels regret. The fence is breached, not weak, like the vigor of the axle of a great carriage.\" The commentary states: \"The fence is breached because of persistent forward pushing.\" \n\nThe nine in the fourth position sits at the intersection of yin and yang lines within the Great Strength hexagram and is also the highest line of the lower nuclear hexagram, symbolizing extreme vitality, as well as being the lowest active line of the upper hexagram, representing movement. Collectively, this means that the nine in the fourth position joins with the yang lines below, breaking through obstacles ahead. It is likened to a ram butting against a fence, with its horns becoming entangled. The only solution in this situation is to break through the fence. Due to the extreme strength of the nine in the fourth position, it ultimately breaks free from the entanglement. The descriptive phrase for its strength—\"like the vigor of the axle of a great carriage\"—portrays the remarkable strength of the nine in the fourth position.\n\nFor those who receive this line, remember: \nA letter writes of great ambitions, with no need to fear the east wind for thousands of miles.\nJust when you have time, you may stumble, but the vast waves permit you to sail.\nWhen having been still for long, consider moving, as disaster will turn to blessing.\nNaturally unobstructed, swiftly traverse a thousand miles on smooth pathways."},"line_5":{"description":"Six in the fifth place: Losing the ram at easy ground, no regrets.\n\nThe image says: Losing the ram at easy ground, the position is not appropriate.","interpretation":"Six Five: Losing sheep in the land of Di.

Line Statement: \"Six in the Fifth: Lost the sheep at the boundary, no remorse.\"\n\nExplanation of the line statement: \"Yi\" is another form of the character for \"boundary.\"\n\nThe meaning of the line statement is: Sheep were lost at the edge of the field, there is nothing to regret.\n\nFrom the hexagram perspective, this sixth line is a yin line in a yang position. The first four lines of the Da Zhuang hexagram are yang lines, while the fifth and top six lines are yin lines. The fifth line faces the rising energy of the four yang lines below. It is within the interchanging Trigram Dui (Nine in the Third, Nine in the Fourth, Six in the Fifth), where Dui represents \"sheep,\" hence the situation of \"losing sheep at the boundary.\" Although Six in the Fifth is a yin line, implying a gentle nature, it possesses the virtue of yielding and adaptability. Being weak but able to comply, gentle yet trustworthy, able to associate with righteous and talented individuals, receiving their support, can lead to accomplishments and virtues, resulting in no regrets.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary explains the line as: \"Losing the sheep at the boundary\" results from an inappropriate position. It points out that \"losing sheep at the edge of the field\" is due to its unfit position.\n\nThe fifth line implies that the advantage of yang is about to be lost. At this moment, one should not expand but rather preserve the gains and protect them from being undermined by others.\n\nFor those receiving this line in divination, it signifies that due to limited ability or indecisiveness, there might be some mistakes in action or losses, similar to losing a sheep at the boundary. However, as a leader, if you treat those around you with humility, listen to their opinions, and seek help from capable subordinates or colleagues, you can achieve great success without regret over temporary mistakes.\n\nSix in the Fifth: Lost the sheep at the boundary, no remorse. Xiang Commentary: Losing the sheep at the boundary is because the position is inappropriate.\n\nThe text indicates that losing the sheep at this boundary does not lead to remorse.\n\nThe Xiang commentary explains it as: Losing the sheep at the boundary is due to the inappropriate position of the fifth line.\n\n\"Losing the sheep at the boundary\" is similar to the \"losing the ox at the boundary\" in the Lu Hexagram, referring to the story of Wang Hai, an ancestor of the Shang dynasty. Wang Hai was skilled in taming cattle and horses, so he raised many cattle, horses, and sheep. He journeyed with his cattle cart, herding cattle and sheep to the Youyi tribe in Hebei for commercial trade, where he was killed, and his cattle and sheep were taken. Wang Hai, originally a sovereign, left his kingly position to engage in business far away, thus \"inappropriately positioned.\" Similarly, the sixth in the fifth, being a yielding line in a noble position, is also \"inappropriately positioned,\" but because it corresponds with the second Nine line and associates with the fourth Nine line, no regrettable events will occur."},"line_6":{"description":"Top sixth: A ram butts against the fence, unable to retreat, unable to advance, with no benefit to be found.

It indicates that only through enduring hardship and adversity can one achieve good fortune. \n\nEveryone will experience moments of being caught between advancing and retreating. When facing such a situation, as long as you persist until the last moment, an opportunity favorable to you will appear.\n\nThe \"Image\" explains this line as: \"Unable to retreat, unable to advance,\" which signifies inauspiciousness; \"difficulty will lead to good fortune\" indicates that misfortune will not last long.\n\nThe \"Image\" points out: \"Unable to move forward or backward\" reflects an action or situation that lacks thoroughness and leads to a highly passive predicament. However, \"enduring hardship, cultivating patience, and not being overwhelmed by adversity will lead to good fortune\" suggests that with perseverance and patience, the challenges can be overcome.\n\nTop six: The ram butts against the fence, unable to retreat, unable to advance, no benefit, difficulty will lead to good fortune.\nThe \"Image\" says: Unable to retreat, unable to advance, indicates inauspiciousness.

Enduring hardship will lead to good fortune.\n\nThe \"Image\" commentary means: The inability to move backward or forward results from a lack of careful consideration initially. Enduring hardship will lead to good fortune because the misfortune will not last long.\n\nIn the \"Great Power\" hexagram, the upper trigram \"Thunder\" symbolizes the fence, and the upper internal trigram \"Lake\" represents the ram, thus there is an image of a ram butting against the fence. However, the top six is in an extremely high position, leading to recklessness in action, yet it is a yin line and lacks the strength of nine-four. Therefore, it is trapped by the fence, unable to advance or retreat. In this situation, one must endure patiently in hardship. Only this way will bring good fortune. Why? Because things will not always remain the same, and eventually, changes will happen that will resolve the predicament of the top six. Thus, the \"Image\" says, \"misfortune will not last long.\""}},"56":{"general":{"description":"Travel.

This is explained in the Sequence of the Hexagrams: \"When one is overwhelmed by abundance, they will inevitably lose their place of dwelling, hence it is followed by 'Traveling'.\" When prosperity reaches its peak without knowing restraint, one certainly leaves their dwelling place, thus following Abundance with Traveling. In the Miscellaneous Hexagrams, it is said: \"Abundance means many old ties, Traveling means few friends or relatives.\" The Hexagram Abundance has many old acquaintances, while the Traveling Hexagram has very few friends or relatives. These have a direct and inverse relationship.\n\nIn the Image, Traveling Hexagram is explained as: Fire on the mountain—is Traveling; the superior person uses discernment carefully in administering punishment and does not keep prisoners.

The position of the third line at the mountain's peak suggests pride and excessive rigidity without adhering to the middle path. The third line is in rebellion with the fourth line above, disobedient to its superior, offending the local host, and leading to expulsion. Due to obstinance and opposition, the way upward is blocked, causing anger towards the subordinates, which results in the servant running away. The third line violates the principles of humility and flexibility, resulting in severe danger.\n\nThe commentary explains: \"Travel leads to burning of the temporary dwelling,\" which indicates injury has occurred; considering the servants as transient people, it is inevitable and logical that they depart.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram line in divination, if traveling, they must remember to be humble and courteous, not arrogant or look down on locals, and avoid conflicts with others, or they will bring disaster upon themselves.

Nine in the Fourth is within the internal trigram Xun (Six in the Second, Nine in the Third, Nine in the Fourth). Xun signifies profit, which here indicates the acquisition of travel resources. It is also in the upper trigram Li, where Li represents weapons, allowing one to obtain axes, hence \"obtaining resources and axes.\" Cheng Yi noted: Resources and axes mean financial resources and the profit of tools. Here, it indicates that Nine in the Fourth, through personal knowledge and ability, earns money and finds stability. However, it loses its position and does not attain correctness, always feeling like a guest rather than the host, with aspirations unfulfilled, leading to constant unease in the heart.\n\nThe Image Commentary explains this line as: \"Traveling in a place,\" not having attained the proper position; \"obtaining resources and axes,\" the heart is not happy. This indicates: \"Residing in a foreign place for a long time\" means being a guest, not a host. \"Even though obtaining financial assistance and tool protection,\" one still resides as a guest in another land, thus the mind cannot be at ease.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, you have been wandering outside for a long time.

The meaning of this line's commentary is: Shooting a pheasant, with a single arrow strike, ultimately achieving honor and a noble appointment. From the perspective of the hexagram, the line of six in the fifth position is a yin line situated in a yielding position, occupying the position of a ruler, adhering to the middle and maintaining righteousness. Thus, actions are smooth and very auspicious. The Image says: \"Ultimately leading to honor and appointment,\" from above it reaches down. This indicates that \"ultimately achieving honor and a noble appointment\" is due to being able to be close to a person of high status.

Feng means greatness.\" The Guimei Hexagram describes returning, likened to people coming together, leading to a populous nation with abundant wealth, hence the following discussion of the Feng Hexagram, which represents greatness.\n\nThe Image explains this hexagram as: \"Thunder and lightning both arrive, Feng; the nobleman uses this to resolve cases and apply justice.\" It points out that the Feng Hexagram's image is Li (fire) below and Zhen (thunder) above, with Li also representing lightning. Zhen stands for thunder, symbolizing the simultaneous arrival of thunder and lightning, representing greatness and abundance. The nobleman should emulate thunder and lightning, approaching judgment and punishment with integrity and transparency.\n\nThe Feng Hexagram is considered one of the most auspicious hexagrams. The Image comments on this hexagram: \"An ancient mirror dimmed for years, now polished to brightness like the full moon. When the nobleman encounters this hexagram in his endeavors, fortune naturally turns favorable.\""},"line_1":{"description":"Initial Nine: Returning maiden as a younger sister, though limping can walk, proceeding is auspicious.   \nThe Image says: Returning maiden as a younger sister signifies constancy.

Equal: refers to being of equal strength or knowledge.\n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: one encounters a master who is compatible; although they are equal in ability and knowledge, it does not matter. The future development will show a rising trend.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the beginning nine is a yang line occupying a firm position, which means it is well-placed. A yang line represents a principled person, symbolizing brightness and motivation. Although the beginning nine does not correspond with the fourth nine in the upper hexagram, they mutually act as guest and host, forming a situation of two yang advancing together.\n\nIn the \"Image\" section, this line is explained as: \"although equal in ability, there is no harm,\" indicating a potential for trouble if one exceeds equality. This indicates: \"although equal in ability and knowledge, it does not matter,\" but if one exceeds equality, trouble will arise.\n\nFor someone obtaining this line, it means that in their endeavors, they will meet someone with comparable ability and shared ambition. The two individuals will work together towards a common goal, complementing each other and achieving mutual success.

Advancing invites doubt, yet exhibiting sincerity and enlightenment brings fortune.\" Explanation of the line statement: Canopy refers to a thatched roof, indicating covering or shielding. Dipper refers to the constellation. Enlightenment means to inspire.\n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: The thatched roof providing covering is enlarged, extending its scope of shelter. The midday sun shines through the gaps, akin to a sky full of stars. When the ruler is so obscured, a virtuous advisor attempting to approach may arouse suspicion. Only by maintaining a humble attitude and accumulating sincere integrity to enlighten the obscured ruler can good fortune be achieved.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, Six in the second position occupies a yin line in a yielding position, situated in the middle of the lower hexagram, appropriate for its position. Six in the second position is opposed to Six in the fifth position; Six in the fifth is a yin line occupying a yang position, representing a muddled ruler, akin to living in a \"roof of canopy,\" shielded from brightness. Six in the second position intends to offer counsel, yet the method of counsel should be one that moves through sincerity, avoiding blame or displeasure to make it effective.\n\nThe \"Image\" commentary interprets this line: \"Exhibiting sincerity brings enlightenment,\" suggesting faith inspires ambition. This commentary highlights: \"Only by maintaining a humble attitude and accumulating sincere integrity to enlighten the muddled ruler\" can one faithfully expand on one's grand ambition.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, there is a strong desire to contribute to the development and growth of a company or group, taking this as a personal responsibility. However, the leader might be incompetent, believing that development is satisfactory and showing no ambition to progress, failing to distinguish between loyalty and deception. In such a situation, advising for correction might arouse suspicion, potentially leading to personal misfortune.

However, it is in correspondence with the topmost line of the hexagram, which is purely yin and dark.\n\nThe commentary in the “Image” section explains this line as follows: “Covering with a canopy, great achievements are not possible; breaking the right arm, in the end, one cannot be used.” This indicates that \"there are more things to cover, curtains are hung,\" and in such darkness, great achievements are impossible; \"the right arm is broken and unable to act,\" ultimately leading to a lack of significant use or achievements.\n\nFor someone receiving this line, although you have great talent, you find yourself unrecognized, with a particularly ignorant leader who does not conduct proper affairs.

The midday sunlight shines through the gaps, resembling a sky full of stars. Although the ruler may be dim and obscured, encountering and gaining the appreciation of a capable person not belonging to the same faction as the ruler can bring good fortune.\n\nThe \"foreign superior\" refers to the broad designation for the \"Huai Yi,\" \"Island Yi,\" and \"Lai Yi\" tribes to the southeast during the time of King Wen and King Zhou of Shang. In the latter period of King Zhou of Shang, when he conquered the Eastern Yi tribes, these tribes did not submit willingly. In the context of this line, \"encountering one's foreign superior\" suggests befriending and treating well the leaders of these southeastern Yi tribes that King Zhou sought to conquer. When King Wu of Zhou waged the Battle of Muye against King Zhou, many of King Zhou's soldiers defected, mostly being captured slaves from the southeastern Yi tribes. These defectors \"turned their weapons to fight,\" paving the way for King Wu's victory over King Zhou.\n\nThe \"Image\" analyzes this line as follows: \"The abundance in its covering,\" indicates an inappropriate position; \"at midday one sees the Dipper,\" signifies obscurity leading to darkness; \"encountering one's foreign superior,\" suggests auspiciousness in action. This highlights that \"the thatched covering of the roof is expanded, broadening its sheltered area,\" suggests an inappropriate position for the nine in the fourth line; \"the midday sunlight shines through the gaps, resembling a sky full of stars,\" illustrates obscurity due to concealment; \"encountering a capable person not belonging to the same faction as the ruler and gaining appreciation,\" still results in auspicious actions.\n\nFor those who receive this line in a divination, it suggests that in your organization, leadership is benighted, troubling you greatly. However, you should continue to diligently perform your duties, not falling into negligence due to the ineptitude of leadership.

Not going out to see the world for many years will surely lead to misfortune.\n\nFrom the hexagram's imagery, the top six, being a yin line in a soft position, is at the top of the Feng hexagram, symbolizing exclusive possession of the harvest's fruits. The top six opposes the sixth five, being proud at high positions and unable to humbly submit to the ruler, becoming secluded in one's dark house and refusing to cooperate with others, which will lead to danger.\n\nThe Image Commentary analyzes this line as: \"Building the house\" suggests roaming in the sky; \"peeking through the window, silence with no people\" refers to self-concealment. Here it indicates: \"Building a house,\" sheltering oneself inside, isolated from others, is like soaring in the sky; \"peeking through the window, silent and without people,\" means deeply concealing one's traces.

Therefore, there will be no cause for regret, and the lost horse will return by itself. However, the initial nine is not at the center of the hexagram, it is positioned rightly but not centrally. Its position is low, yet it displays a tendency for activity, eager to ascend. Because it is in opposition with the line at nine-four, it faces rejection and resistance from it, unable to achieve its upward aspiration. At this time, direct confrontation should be avoided, as the initial nine's position is low, thus it is better to approach those who are against it.\n\nThe Image advises the following about the line: \"Approaching villainous individuals\" is done to avoid calamity. This suggests that by getting close to those who are antagonistic towards oneself and communicating, one can prevent the harm that would come from heightened opposition.\n\nFor those who draw this line, if they have conflicts with friends, they will eventually reconcile and restore their relationship.

However, because it is a yin line, maintaining humility and compliance, its behavior does not deviate from moderation. The nine in the second place is paired with the six in the fifth place, while the six in the fifth occupies the center of the upper trigram, which is a yin line in a central position, acting as the \"leader\" of the entire hexagram and is also misplaced. The six in the third place resides at the top of the lower trigram, above the six in the second place and acts as the immediate superior of the six in the second place, but the six in the third and the six in the fifth are incompatible. The nine in the second naturally wishes to rely on the six in the fifth but finds no opportunity. The six in the fifth goes out for inspection, or for some reason, goes out, and the six in the second meets them in a small alley.\n\nIn \"The Image,\" this line is explained: \"Encountering the master in the alley,\" does not deviate from the path.\n\n\"The Image\" points out: \"Meeting someone of high rank in a small alley,\" although it is unconventional, it does not violate principles.\n\nIf this line is obtained in divination, when going out, one might accidentally encounter someone who can help, or possibly meet a boss or superior in a small alley, or encounter a business opportunity there.\n\nNine in the second place: Meeting the master in the alley, no misfortune. The Image says: Meeting the master in the alley is an illustration that the nine in the second has not lost the harmonious master-servant way.\n\nThe nine in the second place can be compared to a servant of a once wealthy family that has fallen on hard times. The family, due to poverty, seeks livelihoods everywhere and cannot afford to support a servant, thus the servant is also dispersed by the master. One day, the master and a servant meet in a small alley. The servant still regards the old master as their master; how can such loyalty lead to disaster? Meeting in a small alley demonstrates that both the master and servant are not doing very well at that time, but with unity, their combined strength is formidable. When master and servant are in harmony, what difficulties can they not overcome?\n\nIn terms of the hexagram image, the master of the nine in the second place is the six in the third place, as the six in the third is at the top of the inner trigram, symbolizing the head of the household. The lower trigram represents joy, reflecting the joy of master and servant meeting.

Initially, there's misfortune, but the ending turns out well because the third six, a yin line, advances to encounter the fourth nine, a yang line, like a person receiving help from a strong individual.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: For those who obtain this line, there will be obstacles in their plans and aspirations. Seeking safety amidst danger means one will first experience confusion and then find smoothness. Unfavorable individuals may face calamities, causing injuries or harm among family members. For those in official positions, caution is required against the slander of petty individuals.\n\nFu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, explains:\n\nFortune: There may be injuries or harm; endure hardship for three years.\n\nWealth: People are not easily harmonious, no profit can be sought.\n\nDomicile: Facing west is suitable; doubts will first arise, followed by resolution.\n\nBody: There are sores on the face, but they will naturally heal over time.","philosophy":"The third line of the Hexagram Kui reads: \"Six in the third position: You see a carriage being dragged, its ox is constrained; the person is marked with branding and has their nose cut. Although difficult at the start, there is a good ending.\" \n\nExplanation of the line: \n\"Carriage\" refers to a vehicle, \"dragged\" means pulled or towed, and \"constrained\" refers to being restricted or obstructed. \"The person\" refers to the driver. \"Branding\" in ancient times referred to a tattoo-like mark on a convict’s forehead, while \"cutting off the nose\" was a severe punishment.\n\nThe interpretation of this line is: You see a large carriage struggling to advance, with the ox pulling it being hindered, and the driver has suffered the punishment of branding and cutting the nose. Despite enduring great hardship, there will eventually be a good outcome. \n\nThe phrase \"no beginning but has an end\" in the third line suggests that actions should be deep rather than superficial. From the hexagram's structure, the third line, being a yin line in a yang position, is blocked by two yang lines above and below, preventing progress.\n\nThe \"Image\" section explains this line as: \"Seeing the carriage dragged,\" indicates that the position is inappropriate; \"no beginning but has an end,\" denotes encountering strength. Here it is noted that the difficulty of seeing the carriage struggle to move is due to the inappropriate position of the third line. The eventual good outcome is because of alignment with yang strength. Here, \"encountering strength\" means that the third line is supported by the strong line of the upper nine in the hexagram.\n\nDrawing this line suggests that initially things might be very difficult, and one might even find themselves in a predicament, struggling with each step. Yet, in the end, help will come, leading to success. \n\nIf one gets this line, and they face slander or public humiliation, they should not always consider it their fault; it might be due to encountering people with twisted mindsets, and such matters will soon pass.\n\nText for Six in the third position: The carriage is dragged, the ox pulls with effort, and the driver falls face up, hurting his nose. Poor start, but a good result in the end. The image suggests: the carriage is pulled backward due to an improper position, a poor start turns into a good result because of receiving help from the strong (the upper nine).\n\n\"Six in the third\" represents misplaced weakness, reaching an extreme of estrangement, in a difficult situation. But it remains infatuated with the upper nine, so the upper nine’s doubts about the third line dissipate and harmony is restored. \n\nThe third line's situation is quite challenging. The person drives an ox cart, but there is a lot of stuff on the cart, and the ox doesn’t listen, resulting in falling and hurting their face and nose. However, as previously mentioned, they receive help from others, leading to a good outcome. Who helped them? It should be the contributions of the upper nine, nine-four, and nine-three, because the image explains that \"encountering strength\" means the third line received assistance from strong lines, leading to a good outcome."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: In opposition, alone.

The \"great man\" indicates a person of principled strength; it refers specifically to the line at the beginning position, Nine at the beginning. Mutual trust refers to engaging with sincerity and trustworthiness.\n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: One is isolated due to divergent intentions from the group, yet encounters a noble and principled person, engaging with sincerity. Although there is danger, one can avoid calamity.\n\nLine nine at the fourth position suggests \"mutual trust without blame,\" indicating it is appropriate to be sincere rather than insincere. From the hexagram imagery, line nine at this position is a yang line in a yin place, not fitting within the trigrams and out of proper position, surrounded by yin lines above and below, indicating isolation. Within the entire hexagram, it can only interact with the initial line, Nine at the beginning, which is also a yang line.\n\nThe Image interprets this line as \"mutual trust without blame,\" aligning with the principle of united aspiration and action. It points out, \"engaging with sincerity, despite danger, calamity can be avoided\" because of shared objectives and actions.\n\nFor those who draw this line in divination, it suggests being isolated and unsupported in work or life, with the majority opposing your views. At such times, seek out like-minded individuals and engage with them sincerely.

Among his kin, they come together and partake in meat. What danger could there possibly be on the path ahead?\n\nThe principle of line 6-5 is that in handling interpersonal relationships, it is better to be close than distant. Line 6-5 is a yin line occupying a yang position, thus out of place. However, it has three major advantages: flexibility in advancement, being centered, and responding to firmness. Flexibility implies kindness and gentleness; being centered suggests behavior that is balanced and not extreme; responding to firmness indicates the ability to gain the support of virtuous people. By adopting such an approach, not only will regrets disappear, but it also results in unity among those around, aiding in the accomplishment of greater tasks.\n\nThe \"Image\" section analyzes: \"Among his kin, they eat meat together,\" indicating that going forward will undoubtedly result in something worth celebrating. This is because everyone has set aside past grievances, harmoniously united together. With such concerted effort, success is more easily achieved.\n\nFor someone obtaining this line through divination, if there is someone waiting for you, you should boldly proceed, as it might lead to the establishment of a trusting, intimate relationship with this person.\n\nThe meaning of the explanation is: When kin hold a feast and eat meat together, it signifies that proceeding will encounter joyous matters. It speaks of the situation where a family, once wealthy but now struggling, disperses to seek their livelihoods. As a result, one of them achieves success and holds a banquet to entertain people of the same kin. When everyone drinks and eats together, naturally, there are no disasters."},"line_6":{"description":"Top Nine: Estranged and solitary, seeing a pig covered in mire, carrying ghosts in a cart.

Upon realizing the truth, setting out and encountering rain brings good fortune.\n\nThe wisdom this line imparts is: It is better to trust than to doubt. From the hexagram's perspective, the Upper Nine is a yang line in a yin position, isolated and susceptible to illusions and suspicions. Only by removing doubts can one see the truth clearly. In interactions, one should not be suspicious of others but should trust each other. Resolving conflicts this way brings harmony between yin and yang, like the rain falling when yin and yang meet in the sky, ensuring good fortune.\n\nIn the Commentary, it is explained: \"The good fortune of encountering rain\" means that all doubts have vanished.

The commentary suggests that encountering rain is auspicious as many doubts are resolved.\n\nThe Upper Nine is in extreme poverty, and its \"isolation\" is different from the “isolation” of Nine Four, which is due to personality. The loneliness of Upper Nine is due to poverty. The overarching theme of the Hexagram Kan is marital discord caused by poverty.

Mountain Fire Bei consists of stacked dissimilar trigrams: the lower trigram is Li, and the upper trigram is Gen. Li represents fire and brightness; Gen represents mountain and stillness. Bei refers to the luster of shells. The luster and the shells mutually reflect each other, decorating each other with interwoven colors that form a harmonious whole, appearing both elegant and bright.

The noble person uses this to illuminate all governmental affairs and dare not rashly judge cases.\" The Image points out: Li, representing fire, is below, and Gen, representing a mountain, is above.

Tu: refers to walking on foot.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: decorate one's toes, abandon riding the carriage, and walk on foot. The First Nine represents the lower layers of society, who typically do not travel by carriage. As life becomes more affluent, in order to facilitate walking, people begin to adorn their feet. How is it adorned? Trim the toenails, clean the feet, and wear comfortable and sturdy shoes; this is \"adorn the toes.\" Of course, in ancient times, women could also paint various colors on their toenails to beautify their feet.\n\nThe Image says: \"Abandoning the carriage and walking,\" meaning it is not rightfully ridden. That is to say, the First Nine \"abandon the carriage and walk on foot\" because, according to righteousness, it should not be ridden.\n\nFor those who receive this line, seeking to develop a career, relying on others is unreliable; trying to hitch a ride is unfeasible.

Therefore, this idea may not hold much significance for modern people, but it was very useful for the ancients. The ancients believed that \"the skin and hair of the body are received from the parents,\" and thus they shouldn't easily cut their hair or shave their beards. Consequently, beards would grow longer and longer. If not properly groomed, it would indeed affect one's appearance. However, if groomed appropriately, it could also show a manly charm. The ancients had different terms for beards depending on their parts. The hairs above the mouth are called \"zi,\" those below the lower lip are called \"xu,\" those near the chin are called \"hu,\" and those on the cheeks are called \"ran.\" For some ancient men whose beards were too long, they had to make a silk pouch to wrap their beards.\n\nSix Two: Adorn the beard. Life Inspiration\n\nThe “Image” says: “Adorn the beard,” and align with those above. This phrase indicates that the Six Two yin line resides in a yin position, with a gentle disposition. \"Adorning the elder's beard\" implies that the Six Two line is in harmony with the Nine Three line above, mutually embellishing each other. For one who obtains this line in divination, it suggests that at work, they should support their superior leaders and try to speak positively about them.

The person ahead is not an enemy, but the beloved marriage partner one seeks to marry. Wearing clean, beautiful new clothes, riding a white horse, what is the purpose? It is not to rob but to propose. In these prosperous times, there is more emphasis on personal appearance when proposing. Generally, each era develops new customs, with such changes reflecting the progress of the times. In ancient times, proposals involved bloody kidnappings, followed by ghostly appearances at weddings. Now, as people have become more affluent, a healthier way of proposing has begun.

But ultimately, it is auspicious, as a prosperous nation frequently encounters joyous events, and other feudal states often come to visit. By decorating the gardens, the king can elevate his status in the eyes of the feudal lords.\n\nThe meaning of the text is: Decorating hills and gardens, using a large amount of silk cloth, brings concern, yet ultimately brings good fortune. The symbolic meaning is: The good fortune of the Six Five line lies in joyous occasions.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the Six Five line is in the ruler's position, but it is a yin line at this position, indicating the trait of a yin line to adopt a conciliatory approach and possess the virtue of esteeming the worthy and respecting the capable. The topmost nine, a yang line, assists the Six Five in the hexagram, allowing the enterprise to thrive. However, in the hexagram structure, the upper hexagram is Gen, representing mountains and wilderness. The topmost nine, being a yang line, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Six Five, indicating it represents either a retired old official or a reclusive wise person. After assisting the Six Five, the Six Five rewards him. Although the reward may seem meager, this act itself surpasses material value, and since such a wise person does not value material rewards, even though the Six Five might appear somewhat frugal, the outcome is auspicious.\n\nFor those receiving this line in a divination, it suggests that in your work you encounter difficulties, and someone comes forward to assist you in resolving them.

Line saying: \"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\"\n\n\"The upper nine: white adornment, no blame.\" Explanation of the line saying: \n\nWhite signifies the color white, which extends to mean purity and the natural color, embodying the notion of returning to simplicity and truth. The meaning of this line is: using white for adornment, not favoring ostentation, there is no harm. White is a modest color, yet its decorative effect is very good. The upper nine indicates the extreme of things, and generally speaking, when things develop to an extreme, they are not good. However, for adornment, it is different, as the extreme of adornment returns to a state of simplicity, back to a simple state. Looking at the way people dressed in our country after its founding, we find that the highest realm of dress was still simplicity. For example, before the 1980s, people's clothing was uniform in blue, green, and red. After the 1980s, as living standards improved, people started wearing exotic clothes, with a variety of colors and a multitude of styles, but looking at it today, the main fashion market is still dominated by simple one-color clothing. And white clothing has always been a symbol of nobility, unchanged from thousands of years ago until today. Blue clothing has consistently been the best-selling clothing, and the kind most people wear. So, the art of embellishment and decoration follows a cyclical process, returning to the beginning once it reaches the extreme.\n\nThe Image says: \"White adornment, no blame,\" indicating the upper achieves its purpose. \n\nThis advises people: to return to the original pure state, do not use external decorations to beautify. Within the simple and practical form, one can better appreciate the natural beauty of life itself. \n\nIf you obtain this line, should you wish to meet someone, there is no need to dress up deliberately; maintaining natural beauty will not lead to mistakes."}},"37":{"general":{"description":"The Family.

Family members should be harmonious and friendly with one another.","philosophy":"The hexagram of the family, symbolism of the Family Hexagram of Wind and Fire\n\nThe Family Hexagram is a composition of different trigrams, with the lower trigram being Li and the upper trigram being Xun. Li represents fire, and Xun represents wind. Fire causes heat to rise, becoming wind. All things should originate from within and then extend outward. What happens inside forms what is outside. \n\nIt metaphorically suggests one should govern the household first before governing the world. When the household is orderly, the world is at peace and content. \n\nFrom another perspective, the Family Hexagram consists of Xun and Li. Li represents fire, which can be used for cooking; Xun represents wind, which reaches everywhere. Li below and Xun above implies that after people use fire to cook, the whole family eats and then, like the wind, disperses everywhere to engage in their activities, hence the hexagram's name \"Family.\"\n\nThe Family Hexagram follows the Brightness Obscured Hexagram. In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it states: “Those hurt externally must return to the family, hence followed by the Family Hexagram.” The Brightness Obscured Hexagram discusses being harmed in politics, office, or external engagements, implying now is the time to return home and seek stability.\n\nIn the Image commentary, this hexagram is explained: \"Wind rises from the fire; Family. The noble person speaks with substance and acts with persistence.\" This points out that the imagery of the Family Hexagram is Li (fire) below Xun (wind) above, signifying wind coming from fire, like the influence and effect of a family arising from within itself. The noble person should pay special attention to their words and actions, speaking with basis and substance and acting according to standards and rules, avoiding inconsistency and giving up halfway.\n\nThe principal idea expressed by the Family Hexagram is integrity and authority in managing enterprises, and it belongs to the lowest category of hexagrams. In the Image commentary, this hexagram is interpreted as: \"A flower blooms in the mirror, looks stunning but cannot be picked. Advise you not to yearn for the mirrored flower, for encountering this hexagram signifies strangeness.\""},"line_1":{"description":"In the first nine, having tranquility in the home, regrets disappear.  \nThe image says: Having tranquility in the home, the intention has not changed.","interpretation":"At the beginning of the ninth line: Prevent unexpected accidents in the family, there is no regret.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: Preventing unexpected accidents in the family means being alert to unforeseen incidents.","scholar_interpretation":"Level: For those who receive this line, plans will be successful.

Explanation of the line's meaning: Defense refers to precaution and vigilance. It can also mean \"in.\" The meaning of this line is that if a family manages to prevent unforeseen disasters, there will be no faults. From the perspective of the hexagram's image, the Initial Nine line is a yang line in a strong position, marking the beginning of the Family hexagram, suggesting the early stages of forming a family. At this time, it is best to establish rules, as the family members' minds have not yet been influenced by external factors. If bad habits are formed, it becomes difficult to correct them later. \n\nThe Commentary on the Image explains this line as \"There is defense in the home,” indicating that the intention has not changed. It emphasizes that \"Managing the home to prevent unforeseen disasters will result in no faults,\" highlighting the importance of setting a good beginning. If one waits to address issues after they arise, the results will be much less effective. Those who receive this line should restrain themselves, as well as the women and children in the family, establishing correct moral standards from the start. They should instruct family members not to engage in gossip or speak ill of others. In their spare time, they should learn about household management or essential life skills, preventing future regrets within the family. \n\nInitial Nine: Defense is established in the home, and regret is eliminated. The Image commentary states: Defense is established in the home, and the resolve has not changed. The text means that by establishing precautions at home, there will be no cause for regret. The commentary on the Image suggests that establishing precautions means maintaining the original concept of the home. In ancient times, although houses were simple, they all had courtyards. The gate of the courtyard was like a wooden fence, and once closed with a horizontal wooden bar, outsiders could not enter. This horizontal bar was called \"defense.\" It not only prevented outsiders from entering but also served as a weapon. If, upon opening the door, one found visitors with malicious intent, the bar could be used for self-defense. Therefore, for a family, understanding the importance of securing the door with the bar means avoiding regretful situations."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: Nothing is accomplished, but there is good fortune in serving at the center of the household.

Instead, focus on managing the household, cooking, and domestic duties. This brings good fortune.\n\nThe explanation of the meaning: It suggests that one should not desire external fame or achievements but should instead devote oneself to the management of the household's daily affairs. By doing so, you will achieve good results and fortune.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the second line is a yin line in a soft position, indicating a lack of strong yang energy and intellect. Therefore, pursuing a career in society may not lead to the desired outcomes. The second yin line is at the lower part of the hexagram Li, which symbolizes fire, and within the trigrams Kan (Six Two, Nine Three, Six Four), symbolizing water. Together, this represents the image of cooking and boiling over a fire. The second line also embodies qualities of gentleness and compliance, leading to fortune.\n\nThe Image explains this line as: The fortune of the second line lies in its capacity to be smooth and gentle. It emphasizes that the six-two position can bring about good fortune because it is centered appropriately, in line with norms, and is gentle and submissive.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, if encountering career obstacles or lack of success, one should consider cooking at home, entertaining family and friends, or preparing gifts to present to them. This will bring auspicious outcomes.\n\nSecond Line: Do not act on your own wishes. At midday, begin eating, and adhere to the correct path for fortune.\n\nThe Image's explanation is that the fortune of the second line lies in being smooth and gentle.\n\nThe six-two line corresponds with the nine-five line, analogous to harmony between husband and wife in a household. The six-two line is situated within the inner trigram and properly positioned, representing a wife who upholds the family's principles. Within the traditional context, the wife is not the head of the family; she must consult her husband for decisions. Her primary role is to manage the household. By preparing a delicious meal by midday and listening to her husband's guidance, she adheres to the right path, bringing good fortune. This fortune is not only personal to the six-two but also benefits the entire family. It is important to note this reflects feudal-era thinking, which is less suitable in modern times where gender equality allows many men to take on what was traditionally the role of the six-two line. Times have changed."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: The family members communicate with strict severity, remorse brings danger, but ultimately there is good fortune.

Line Statement Explanation: \"Rebuked\" is the sound of anger and reprimand. \"Laugh carelessly\" is the sound of reckless laughter.\n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: Managing the household with excessive severity often leads to regret for overly reprimanding family members, but ultimately the family does not fall apart, and in the long term, there is good fortune. If one is overly indulgent, allowing the women and children to laugh as they please, the ultimate development will certainly not be good.\n\nThe Family Hexagram's third line, Line Statement: Nine in the Third: The family members are rebuked, regret leads to severity, yet auspicious; the wife and children laugh carelessly, ultimately disgrace results. Life Lesson: From the hexagram, the third line is a yang line residing in a strong position, representing the father within the family. The father should uphold the family rules and take on the responsibility of discipline. If family members behave incorrectly, they can be sternly reprimanded. It is known that \"strictness is love, leniency is harmful.\"\n\nIn the Image it is explained: \"The family members are rebuked,\" there is no loss; \"the wife and children laugh carelessly,\" indicates loss of family order. It points out that \"being too severe in managing the household\" aligns with the principles of family governance, and though there may be mistakes, the fundamental is not lost. Allowing \"women and children to act as they please\" ultimately leads to undesirable results, as it violates the principles and rules of family management.\n\nThose who receive this line in a reading should not indulge their emotions and must firmly limit foolish behavior and excessive entertainment, otherwise regretful incidents will occur.\n\nNine in the Third: The family members are reprimanded, regretful severity leads to auspiciousness; the wife and children laugh carelessly, ultimately disgrace results. The Image says: \"The family members are reprimanded,\" there is no loss; \"the wife and children laugh carelessly,\" is the loss of family moderation. The text means: Family members being reprimanded indicates strict household management that is auspicious; the women and children laughing carelessly warns of eventual worry and disgrace. The Image statement means: Family members being reprimanded indicates the family law is still intact; women and children laughing carelessly is the loss of family moderation.\n\nThe third line pertains to the uppermost line of the lower trigram Li, with the lower trigram symbolizing the interior of the household, thus making the third line function as the head of the family here. What should the head of the family do? The head of the family should enforce moral and household laws to restrain each family member, strictly.

Interpretation of the line statement: The meaning of the statement is to enrich the home, bringing great prosperity and fortune. From the perspective of the hexagram imagery, the fourth line belongs to a yin line in a yielding position, and it has already entered the upper trigram. The role is not only that of a virtuous wife but also a good mother. This line is the initial line of the upper trigram and is in direct correspondence with the ruler line at the fifth place. Xun represents obedience, symbolizing the good mother who, with gentle and proper virtue, assists the impartial and strict father in managing the household's finances carefully. The wealth of the household is a result of the wife’s skill in managing finances, and it also signifies a thriving family, which is also the result of the good mother's nurturing. The \"Xiang\" or image commentary explains this line as: \"Enriching the home brings great fortune; it is due to being in the proper position.\" It points out that the reason this line \"is able to enrich the home, bringing great prosperity and fortune\" is determined by its nature of gentleness and submission. Six in the fourth place: enriching the home, great fortune. The Image says: enriching the home, great fortune, stems from being in the proper position. The text implies that a wealthy family brings great prosperity and fortune. The image commentary suggests that the family's wealth and great fortune come from the gentle and suitable position of the fourth line. The fourth line is at the bottom of the upper trigram, Xun, which carries the meaning of \"gaining triple profit,\" so the fourth line will make the family very wealthy. In modern terms, it indicates that the fourth line has the talent to bring wealth.

Through his personal character, he should earn the respect and love of the family, encouraging each member to bring out their strengths.\n\nThe commentary in the \"Image\" section analyzes this line as follows: \"The king approaches the family\" means mutual love and affection.

It is not in the palace; the king's family symbolizes the country. When the king makes all people love each other as a family, the people unite closely, ensuring stability in the nation. This is the idea of grand unity among various ethnic groups. In ancient times, the Emperor was considered the chief leader of all vassal states, and hence, he had to promote the idea of great unity. This wasn’t just propagated ideologically but also facilitated through marital alliances to promote unity.

With movement within compliance, there is inner yang and outer yin, progressing and retreating with ease, conducive to the previous Zhen as thunder, which is the inner trigram; and Kun as earth, which is the upper trigram. Thunder within the earth signifies that when the thunder rumbles, the earth loosens, and all things begin to sprout. Fu signifies revival and return, marking a turning point for the rebirth of things. From the hexagram’s image, except for the first line which is yang, the rest are yin, resembling the scene of the sun rising from the horizon. Fu Hexagram represents the solar term of the Winter Solstice, akin to \"when winter comes, can spring be far behind?\" It signifies the revival of yang forces and the decline of yin elements, as the sun rises after a long night. The Fu Hexagram teaches the principle and philosophy of leaving and returning, and advises that recognizing mistakes and promptly returning to the right path is necessary for auspicious outcomes. If one remains stubborn, disaster will ensue.\n\nThe Fu Hexagram follows the Bo Hexagram, as stated in the Sequence of Hexagrams: \"Things cannot come to a complete end. When the stripping is extreme, it turns back down, therefore it is followed by Fu.\" When the Bo Hexagram reaches its extreme, the yang line must return to the bottom to start anew. Fu Hexagram is the reverse of the Bo Hexagram, described as \"returning from stripping,\" initiating a situation of \"one yang starting afresh,\" and the earth re-emerges with vitality.\n\nThe Fu Hexagram reveals the principle of movement within compliance, belonging to the middle trigram.

Benefactors become ingratious, creating grievances, and disputes arise out of nowhere.\"\n\nThe name of the hexagram is Fu. Fu, as explained in the Shuowen Jiezi, means \"coming and going.\" Hence, Fu implies returning. The Nine in the Third Line of the previous Tai Hexagram states \"in going, they do not necessarily return,\" indicating that nothing advances continuously without returning, as things have a cyclical and repetitive pattern. In the previous Bo Hexagram, multiple yin lines stripped away the yin line, followed by the revival of one yang. Thus, the Fu Hexagram follows the Bo Hexagram. This aligns with the narrative in the Sequence of Hexagrams: “Things cannot come to a complete end. When the stripping is extreme, it turns back down, therefore it is followed by Fu.”"},"line_1":{"description":"Initial nine: Not far to return, there is no regret, great fortune.\nThe image says: The return is not far, as it is used for self-cultivation.","interpretation":"Beginning Nine: Going out and returning without going far, there are no major faults, great fortune and prosperity.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Going out and returning without going far symbolizes the ability to frequently reflect and strictly cultivate oneself.","scholar_interpretation":"Auspicious: Those who receive this line will find everything to go as they wish, and efforts in business will bring profits.

'Di Regret' means great regret.\n\nThe meaning of this line text is: One who has not gone far can return to the righteous path, preventing any serious regret, leading to immense good fortune.\n\nThe Initial Nine line uses a journey as a metaphor to teach people the principle of doing things: If one realizes early on that they are on the wrong path, turning back immediately will prevent significant regret and avoid mistakes. This implies that when one notices a mistake at the very beginning, they correct it and proceed according to the right methods, thus avoiding mistakes and not causing much regret.\n\nThe Image says: \"Not far in returning, for self-cultivation.\" This advises people that as soon as action begins, they should demonstrate the ability to acknowledge and correct mistakes, returning to the righteous path. It emphasizes the importance of personal cultivation."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: Restoring brings good fortune.  \nThe Image says: The good fortune of restoring comes from cultivating benevolence below.","interpretation":"Line Six in the second position: Returns fulfilled and complete, auspicious.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: The reason why returning fulfilled and complete is auspicious is because one can relinquish a position to let the worthy take it.","scholar_interpretation":"Auspicious: Those who obtain this line will share benefits with others, have a prosperous career, and the sick will recover.

The meaning of this line's text is to stop and return, which is auspicious.\n\nSecond line of the Fu Hexagram, Yao Text: Six in the second place: Halt and return, good fortune. Life's lesson\n\nThis line, Six in the second place, belongs to the yin line located in a flexible position, gaining advantage. Once the Six in the second place discovers a mistake, it no longer proceeds onward and returns to the proper path, resulting in good fortune.\n\nThe Image says: \"The good fortune of halting and returning\" is due to being humane.\n\nThis indicates that \"halting and returning is auspicious\" because the Six in the second place can reach out gently to those who possess benevolence. In terms of the hexagram imagery, this virtuous person is represented by the first nine. The first nine is a yang line in a yang position, a gentleman, a benevolent person, whom the Six in the second place greatly appreciates.\n\nThose who draw this line when consulting should, for example, when assigning subordinates or family members to do something, if the person finds a mistake and stops working on it, you should also cease the matter, and this will be auspicious.\n\nNot returning is also auspicious. How can this be? Because the Six in the second place differs from the first nine. The first nine symbolizes the growth of yang energy, whereas the Six in the second place represents the waning of yin energy, so the Six in the second place must move forward to be auspicious. The advancement of the Six in the second place is an ascent, allowing the yang energy below to grow more, adapting to the circumstances, hence it is auspicious. The Six in the second place, as a yin line in an even position, finds its proper place, being in the lower part of the hexagram and compatible with the first nine. Therefore, it is gentle and aligned with the times, possessing the virtue of adapting to circumstances, thus will wisely progress upward."},"line_3":{"description":"Six in the third place: Repeatedly returning.

Dangerous, no blame.\n\nExplanation of the line statement:\n\"Repeated\" refers to frequent, repeated occurrences. This line statement means: repeatedly making mistakes but then being able to repeatedly correct them, returning to the right path. Although there is danger, ultimately there will be no misfortune.\n\nThis third line closely resembles the saying, \"Make a mistake, correct it, make it again, then correct it again,\" indicating a lack of strong determination and inadequate self-cultivation, unlike Confucius' disciple Yan Hui, who \"did not repeat his mistakes\" and, knowing he was wrong, would not err again. Six in the third place, during the process of returning to the right path, struggles with old habits that are difficult to change, experiencing ups and downs repeatedly, which is very dangerous. However, he knows his errors, though his willpower is not strong. Ultimately, he can correct his ways and return to righteousness, so he will encounter no misfortune. For those who receive this line, it is important to be firm in correcting mistakes, determined to wage a \"bloody battle\" against bad habits and uproot them, as this is more beneficial to oneself.\n\nSix in the third place is at the outermost part of the lower trigram, at the upper line of Zhen, which represents movement, so he frequently moves. He wants to return to the central position, hence \"repeated return.\" However, this approach does not align with the developmental laws of the time, creating danger, but he can learn from the failures of \"repeated return,\" resulting in no disaster. In modern terms, it is like saying \"failure is the mother of success.\" Continuously moving backward, he repeatedly faces setbacks, enlightening him to the error of his ways, leading him to choose the correct path."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Walking in the middle, alone he returns.  \nThe Image says: Walking in the middle, alone he returns; this is to follow the Way.","interpretation":"Six in the Fourth Place: Returns alone halfway.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Returning alone halfway is a return to the path of righteousness.","scholar_interpretation":"Level: Those who receive this line can expect good fortune; plans will be profitable.

Alone: Refers to being by oneself. \n\nThe meaning of this line statement is: Originally walking in the middle of the ranks, now returning alone. \n\nThe commentary states: \"Walking in the middle, one returns alone,\" indicating following the way. It points out that the one at the fourth position initially walked in the middle of the ranks but returned alone, aiming to return to the right path.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fourth line is located among a series of yin lines, two above and two below, thus \"walking in the center.\" The person in the middle should be a leader or initiator. It is typically easier for followers to change their minds and return, but for a leader or initiator, returning is not easy.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, they should pay attention to observe the things they are doing and their partners. Although the matter is led and undertaken by you as the organizer, if an error is found, you must immediately turn back. Even if others disagree or are unwilling to follow you, you should withdraw yourself and return alone.\n\n\"Walking in the middle, one returns alone\" refers to the correspondence between the fourth line and the initial \"six-four,\" indicating correctness, the ability to disregard fortune or misfortune, and independently return to the right path. It is in resonance with the ninth line. This means he supports the growth of yang energy. The commentary says \"following the way,\" referring to the way the universe operates, with yang beginning to grow, leading to the gradual strengthening of yang energy and the gradual weakening of yin energy, which is the way of the universe's operation. The fourth line understands this universal principle, hence he supports the growth of the initial nine."},"line_5":{"description":"Six in the fifth place: Sincere return, no regrets.  \nThe Image says: Sincere return without regrets, examining oneself with moderation.","interpretation":"Nine in the fifth position: After careful deliberation, the decision to return can be made without regret.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: After careful deliberation, the decision to return can be made without regret, meaning that one examines oneself with the path of righteousness from within.","scholar_interpretation":"Fortunate: Receiving this line indicates accumulation, but one must be cautious of unexpected events concerning the father.

However, it resides within the upper trigram of Kun, practicing the middle way without stubbornness, possessing the virtues of sincerity and good-naturedness.\n\nThe \"Image\" says: \"Restoring genuinely, without regret\" is because of self-reflection.\n\nIt points out here that \"returning sincerely to the right path, there will be no regret\" because although the sixth line in the fifth position is far from the firm and strong, it can examine and reflect on its actions and words to improve itself. Through this means, it prompts itself to return to correctness.\n\nThose who receive this line should be adept at self-examination and self-reflection, quickly identifying mistakes and correcting them. When acting, if continuing forward is found to be unbeneficial, even if one has traveled a long path, returning now is correct, which will yield a favorable outcome.\n\nThe sixth line in the fifth position resides at the central position of the upper trigram. The upper trigram of Hexagram Fu is Kun, whose spirit is capable of \"bearing all with great virtue,\" thus representing the image of \"restoring genuinely.\" \"Dun\" means \"sincere.\" The sixth in the fifth position can adapt to circumstances, and by newly recognizing itself, understands the unstoppable growth of yang energy, and thus can withdraw in accordance with the times, without regret."},"line_6":{"description":"Top six: Bewildered return, ominous, there is disaster and misfortune.

Explanation of line text: \n\nLost and confused: Refers to being obstinately stuck in one's mistakes and unwilling to correct them. \n\nCalamity and misfortune: \"Calamity\" refers to adversity caused by external factors, while \"misfortune\" is a disaster brought on by oneself, self-inflicted harm. \"Calamity\" comes from outside, \"misfortune\" originates from within; together they imply a disaster.\n\nUnable to conquer: \"Conquer\" means competent; \"unable to conquer\" indicates not being able to fulfill the mission of conquest.\n\nThe meaning of this line text is: Having made a mistake and still remaining obstinate without repentance or returning to the correct path will surely lead to danger, with constant calamities and misfortunes happening. In such circumstances, deploying troops will ultimately lead to a great defeat; in governance, the ruler will encounter peril. If the situation does not change, the state should not engage in military campaigns for ten years.\n\nThe top six line is positioned at the uppermost line of the hexagram of Return, being the first target to be eliminated by the first yang line at the beginning of nine, occupying an extremely vigorous position, neither corresponding with nor resonating with the lines below, and not being central. Thus, its situation is one of internal worries and external troubles, the most disadvantageous. The terms \"confused,\" \"employing troops,\" \"great defeat,\" and \"ten years\" are derived from the image of the Earth hexagram. In the symbolic imagery of the myriad things of the Earth hexagram, it represents the masses, loss, and ten years. Therefore, expressions such as \"employing troops,\" \"great defeat,\" and \"ten years\" appear in the line text. The \"confused\" term in the line text is derived from the Earth hexagram line text of \"first lost, later obtaining a lord,\" yet here only the image of \"lost\" appears without the image of \"obtaining a lord,\" making the situation more ominous. Its danger arises from the threat of the first yang line at the beginning of nine, which is equivalent to the sovereign in the hexagram of Return. Hence, it is said that the danger for the top six line comes from the ruler."}},"16":{"general":{"description":"Yu.

However, in the hexagram, the fifth line holds the sovereign position, and the fourth line, being a yang line in a yin position, should thus treat the fifth line with utmost sincerity to avoid suspicion.

The fifth line is not in its rightful position, with less power than the fourth line, but since it is centralized and occupies the ruler's position, it remains safe and untroubled.\n\nThe fifth line is said to be plagued by illness. What is the cause of this? Yu Fan explains: \"Kan represents illness, Kun represents death, and Zhen represents resurrection. The position is situated in the middle of Zhen, separating itself from the Kun's death influence, hence 'perseverance brings illness, yet it is not fatal.'\" This means that in the Yu hexagram, the upper correlated hexagram is Kan, which implies illness, placing the fifth line on the edge of illness. Additionally, since Kun represents the grave and signifies death, but the upper hexagram of Yu is Zhen, which has no connection to Kun and carries a meaning of revival, the fifth line is in a midpoint position within the Zhen hexagram. Therefore, it suffers from illness but will not die because of it.\n\nYet, what kind of illness does the fifth line have? It is a heart affliction. Why say so? Because Kan represents heart ailments. The heart trouble of the fifth line stems from the fourth line. For example, the fourth line is a man, and the surrounding yin lines are his five wives, with one wife leading at home, exerting authority over the husband—this wife being the fifth line. Why does the fifth line have heart trouble? Because the husband loves the second and third lines more, the authoritative fifth line naturally feels jealousy and hence heart trouble. However, because the fifth line remains central, it manages the household with moderation despite the emotional wounds and does not lose its life over them. Nevertheless, this jealousy causes it to hover at the brink of life and death. If one consults regarding health, it implies falling ill but not fatally so."},"line_6":{"description":"Top line six.

The top six is the final line of the entire hexagram, suggesting that joy has reached its peak, becoming somewhat blind and stubborn. However, since the hexagram has reached its end, there is no further path, change is inevitable, thus there can be \"no blame.\"\n\nThe top six indulges in pleasure to the point of losing clarity, but if one can realize one's own faults early and correct them promptly, there will be no grave mistakes. When pleasure is excessive, its harm will soon manifest, meaning that subsequent joy cannot be sustained. Unable to possess joy anymore, but able to recognize the harm of excessive joy, naturally one will avoid further mistakes.\n\nThose who draw this line should reflect on themselves: whether they have neglected important duties due to excessive playfulness, or cultivated a habit of indulgence in entertainment, thereby trapping themselves in a crisis.

This marks the end.” The Ji Ji hexagram comes to exhaustion over time, so it is necessary to renew vitality, demonstrating the I Ching principle of change without exhaustion, by having Wei Ji as the finale of the sixty-four hexagrams. “Wei Ji” represents something that is yet unfinished, as explained in the Image: Fire above water, Before Completion; the superior man differentiates things carefully and takes proper position. Here it points out that the hexagram image is Kan (Water) below Li (Fire) above, a symbol of fire over water. Fire burning fiercely, water surging strongly, fire and water oppose and restrain each other, symbolizing incompleteness; the superior man must at this time distinguish all kinds of things clearly, understand the essence of things, and strive to make changes in things move toward the positive, and in doing so, everything can be accomplished.\n\nThe Wei Ji hexagram symbolizes an unfinished endeavor and belongs to the lower-middle class of hexagrams.

When encountering a hexagram with Kan water below and Xun wind above, it naturally brings to mind that the wind above can disperse the water, and so this Kan below, Xun above hexagram is called Huan.

However, it is situated in the middle of the lower trigram Kan, which is a position of danger. Furthermore, its upward progression is obstructed, and it does not receive recognition or important roles from the leaders in the upper trigram. Fortunately, it gains support from the Initial Six below. Therefore, during turbulent times, even though it cannot find a strong backing, it can still find a place of safety and be sheltered by the Initial Six. This allows it to accumulate strength while awaiting new opportunities.\n\nIn the \"Xiangs,\" the analysis of this line is as follows: \"Dispersion flees to its resting place,\" achieving one's wish.

Dui represents joy and symbolizes a lake; Kun represents compliance and symbolizes the earth. The earth is above, and the lake is below, symbolizing the supervision of the earth over the waters of the lake from a high position. The earth presses down upon the lake, akin to a superior exerting pressure on a subordinate, imposing their will. This hexagram is named Lin, which originally means to look down from above. The implication of this hexagram is the leadership and management of superiors over subordinates. Depending on the object confronted, it includes meanings like a ruler dominating the people or confronting matters personally. How to properly handle the relations between oneself and others, the subject and the object, is the theme discussed in the Lin Hexagram. In the Image, Lin Hexagram is thus explained: \"There is earth above the lake, Lin; the gentleman uses it to teach with endless thoughtfulness and to protect the people with boundless virtue.\"\n\nThe statement in the Image reveals that the hexagram image is earth (Kun) above lake (Dui), representing the image of earth above water. Earth above lake, with the earth occupying a high position, symbolizes oversight. Inspired by this, the gentleman diligently educates the people and protects them with his vast virtues.\n\nThe Earth over Lake Hexagram uses the symbol of the earth adjoining and exchanging air with the waters of the lake, illustrating the peaceful coexistence between the ruler and the people, where the ruler stays close to the people, and the people are pleased with the ruler. This hexagram implies both leaders visiting subordinates and subordinates respectfully welcoming leaders. The Lin Hexagram reveals the principles of enlightening and protecting the people, belonging to higher-level hexagrams. The Image interprets the hexagram as: \"A ruler without virtue leaves the people in distress, always hoping to dispel the clouds and see the blue sky. Fortunately, encountering a wise ruler administering benevolent governance, people can again live peacefully and naturally.\"\n\nThe hexagram drawing of Earth over Lake consists of two yang lines below and four yin lines above.\n\nAnalyzing from the hexagram image, the two yang lines below symbolize the gradual increase of yang energy, which can further signify the growth of righteousness. Lin Hexagram is one of the twelve seasonal hexagrams, representing the solar term of Major Cold. The six lines of Lin Hexagram represent the thirty or so days from Lesser Cold to the beginning of Spring, with each line symbolizing one of the pentads. At this time, the hexagram image already has two yang energies, indicating the gradual strengthening of yang energy. Therefore, Lin Hexagram also implies greatness. Moreover, the upper hexagram is Kun for earth, and the lower hexagram is Dui for lake, so the image is that of the earth above the lake, which is the image of Lin Hexagram. What does \"earth above lake\" mean? It means, around the lake, there is endless land, and the land is at a level higher than the lake, hence \"earth above lake.\" Looking from the land at the edge towards the lake from above, this is Lin.

The analysis of this line suggests that \"approaching the people with an intention to influence and transform them can bring good fortune without any disadvantage.\"\n\nFrom the hexagram perspective, the second line is a yang line in a firm position, demonstrating the decisive and assertive characteristics of yang lines. The second line corresponds to the fifth line, which is a yin line in a ruler's position, yet is misplaced. Both the second and fifth lines are misplaced, indicating that during actions, the second line's opinions conflict with the fifth line and do not follow the fifth line's command. However, this does not result in any misfortune because the second line acts without selfish motives and approaches the people with humility and gentleness.\n\nIf you receive this line in a divination, when taking action, you should maintain sincerity and adopt an attitude of humility and gentleness towards others, adhering to the righteous path. Even if you go against the orders of superiors, no adverse outcomes will occur.\n\nThe second line is the position of a high-ranking official, and although it occupies an even position, it is able to remain centered. By conducting oneself with righteousness, one naturally receives recognition from above.

The \"Xiang\" points out that \"taking a superior position and relying on sweet words to direct others\" is due to the inappropriate position of the third line. However, \"realizing the issue and making corrections out of fear\" means that the harm will not last long. The \"Xiang\" analyzes from the hexagram image, saying that the third line is a yin line in a strong position, an inappropriate place, and positioned at the top of the lower trigram, far from the middle position, thus unable to maintain balance. Relying on flowery speech to rule the people, saying much but doing little, and being good at putting on shows.\n\nThose who obtain this line, if you are a leader, should reflect on your attitude towards subordinates. Consider whether you always rely on pleasant words to win them over, making empty promises without fulfilling them. If so, you must immediately correct this behavior, reduce cunning actions, and correct mistakes to ensure no hindrance.\n\nThe scripture's meaning is: treating the approach sweetly brings no benefit; being worried about the situation prevents disaster. The commentary's meaning is: sweet treatment of the approach is due to an inappropriate position. If worried about this situation, the disaster will not last long.\n\nThe six in the third position is at the top of the lower trigram Dui, suggesting joy, and positioned above two yang lines, implying benefits. However, despite wielding more power than the two yang lines, it cannot gain appreciation from above, thus \"has nothing beneficial.\" The six in the third position, a yin line in a strong position and not central, finds itself in an unfavorable situation.

The fourth line is the position of a high-ranking official close to the ruler and serves as an assistant to the high fifth position. The six in the fourth is close to the six in the fifth, and corresponds with the first nine. As a high-ranking official close to the ruler, being able to uphold righteousness, loyal in duty to the superior, it can also support worthy talents like the first nine. The first nine is a yang line, and the six in the fourth is a yin line, making it clear that if the yang line in the first nine gains power, the yin line in the six in the fourth will be affected, yang prospers while yin wanes. However, the six in the fourth does not concern itself with personal gain and recommends worthy talents for the leader, thus there is no calamity.\n\n\"The Image\" interprets this line: \"To personally administer state affairs, there is no fault\" because the position is appropriate. \"The Image\" explains that \"personally handling state affairs, there is no calamity,\" is due to the appropriateness of the six in the fourth position. In a high position, it does not deceive the ruler above nor oppress the people below, diligently and earnestly, actively recommending the capable, paving the way for the emerging talents, earning praise. Just like in the Spring and Autumn period, Bao Shuya, the teacher of Duke Huan of Qi, who was a close official to the ruler, devoted himself entirely to serving Duke Huan of Qi, while also recommending talents to him. Under his advice, Duke Huan used Guan Zhong, who had once shot at him, as a minister. With Guan Zhong's assistance, they established a hegemonic position. Bao Shuya, without considering his own fame and fortune, stepped down in favor of the worthy, earning public acclaim.\n\nThose who draw this line should learn from Bao Shuya, even if they suffer some temporary losses or grievances, they will ultimately gain fame and fortune.\n\nThe six in the fourth is in the position of a feudal lord, yet it can correspond with the first nine, hence it is called \"to personally administer.\" This means the six in the fourth is able to understand the people's conditions, delving into the lowest levels, connecting heart to heart with the common people.

The six in the fifth position is a soft line that occupies a central position in the upper trigram, embodying the virtue of loyalty and obedience as a sovereign. The Commentary explains that \"to implement governance with wisdom and intelligence is the most suitable way for a great sovereign to rule,\" referring to the way of moderation, using softness to overcome hardness, using the softest of the world to triumph over the hardest.\n\nThose who obtain this line should learn from the approach of the six in the fifth position. Even if one's career encounters setbacks, following this approach can rescue one from danger and revitalize one's career. For those obtaining this line, their aspirations will succeed, and the awaited news will soon have a response.\n\nUsing wisdom to understand the sentiments of the people is a skill that a sovereign must master. The six in the fifth position uses wisdom to understand the sentiments of the people, obtaining true situations, hence auspicious. As a sovereign, one must understand their own subjects. On the Tiananmen Gate, there are two huabiao, each with a small beast with its head facing different directions, one facing south, the other north. Is there a saying about this? Yes, the beast facing south is a reminder for the sovereign not to forget to frequently go among the common people to understand their sentiments. Why do this? Because ministers may embellish the truth and speak falsehoods to the sovereign. For example, after Yuan Shikai became emperor, there was national opposition. Some ministers, to flatter Yuan Shikai, printed a newspaper for him, only one copy every day, only for his eyes. It contained nothing but good news, bringing him joy. Consequently, eighty-one days after ascending the throne, he was ousted. Therefore, a sovereign must use their own eyes to see the lives of their people. During the prosperous periods of the Qing dynasty, Kangxi and Qianlong frequently visited Jiangnan to inspect and understand the sentiments of the people. The huabiao on Tiananmen with the beast facing north is a reminder for the sovereign not to forget the safety of state affairs while inspecting and traveling outside. If the sovereign is always out inspecting, what if traitorous ministers rebel in the court? Thus, the sovereign must not spend too much time outside; they must return to consolidate their rule.\n\nHowever, if a sovereign cannot go out for a long time, how can they grasp the true sentiments of the people? This requires \"wise approach\". How to \"approach with wisdom\"? The private visits of Kangxi and Qianlong in disguise depicted on television are an example, though apart from private visits in disguise, loyal ministers can also be dispatched to inspect and obtain accurate information. But the key lies in \"wisdom\"; only with \"wisdom\" can true \"approach\" be achieved."},"line_6":{"description":"Top six: Genuine approach, auspicious, without fault.  \nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the genuine approach lies in the inner resolve.","interpretation":"Top six: Governing the people with a method of generosity leads to auspiciousness; naturally, there will be no disasters or misfortunes.

Explanation of the Line Statement: \"Sincere\" refers to the virtue of being sincere and honest.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: Governing the people with sincerity and honesty brings auspiciousness and no misfortune.\n\nLine Statement: Top Six: Sincere presence, auspicious, without fault. Life Lessons\n\nThe commentary states: \"The auspiciousness of sincere presence\" signifies inner ambition. The commentary explains that governing the people with sincerity and honesty is auspicious and free of misfortune, indicating an ambition to benefit the nation and the family. Those who receive this line should remember to be sincere and kind-hearted, which is the main lesson this line offers. In work and life, one should generously accept various opinions, including some criticisms. This kind of sincere elder's demeanor will earn you respect from others. In dealing with subordinates, show your virtue of sincerity, and thus you will find auspiciousness and avoid calamity.\n\nThe top six occupies the position of the Supreme Emperor, naturally losing some of the king's authority, so he must inspect the people with a sincere disposition. In ancient times, the realm was the realm of the ruler's family, so the Supreme Emperor also had to contribute to the peace of the kingdom. He peacefully associates with the people to gain true insights into their affairs, and then assists the emperor in planning governance decisions for the nation.\n\nThe top six also belongs to the recluse class. In ancient times, recluses made significant contributions to society. They appeared to live in seclusion in the mountains and forests, but their hearts were attached to the state. Without position and power, they were more capable of understanding the true thoughts of the people. Moreover, recluses often had certain interactions with rulers, and rulers valued this class, so recluses often offered valuable advice to the king for governing the nation."}},"17":{"general":{"description":"Following.

Thunder represents movement, while Lake represents joy; movement coupled with joy is \"Following.\" Following refers to mutual compliance, where one adapts to things, and things adapt to oneself, facilitating communication.

However, it is essential to note the position and principles when following others and not to follow blindly or curry favor, as this could result in disaster.","philosophy":"The Hexagram of Following, represents following, compliance, being amenable, and so on. This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacked together, with Thunder below and Lake above. Thunder signifies movement; Lake signifies joy. Therefore, movement combined with joy constitutes \"Following.\"\n\nAnalyzing from the trigrams' imagery, within the Hexagram of Delight, the upper trigram represents Lake, symbolizing pleasure, while the lower trigram represents Thunder, symbolizing action. Thunder within the lake, where joy arises with movement, is the imagery of the Hexagram of Delight. How can thunder be hidden within marshy land? Ancient people observed that after the spring thunder, hibernating animals were awakened, leading to the revival of all living things and an atmosphere of vitality on earth. However, after the lunar August of autumn, thunder ceases, and some animals begin preparing for hibernation. Observing this phenomenon, the ancients considered it to be the benevolence of the way of heaven: as the weather warms, heaven uses thunder to awaken the creatures on earth; as the weather cools, heaven hides the thunder away, no longer disturbing the earthly beings. During this period, the marshlands would emit a sound, leading people to believe that, come autumn, thunder hides in the marshlands. From this hexagram image, we can understand that the Hexagram of Following also signifies moving according to timing. With the thunder trigram representing movement and the lake trigram representing joy, it implies moving with joy and pursuing joy.\n\nThe imagery of the Hexagram of Following: a goose carrying a message in the clouds denotes the arrival of news; a pile of money hints at wealth and righteousness; someone inside a red gate signifies an official position; a person standing outside the gate implies a scholar seeking advancement and transformation. In all matters, this suggests the assistance of benefactors. It is a hexagram of refining good stone into jade, akin to water pushing the strokes of a painting."},"line_1":{"description":"At the beginning of nine, if the official position changes, steadfastness brings good fortune.

However, you need not be troubled by this, as long as you adhere to the right path, ultimately, there will be auspicious outcomes. If you feel unhappy due to the change in your position, consider going outside, as you may make better friends or find opportunities to build new achievements. However, you must adhere to righteousness and follow goodness to avoid mistakes.\n\nThe Hexagram of Following comes from the transformation of the Hexagram of Obstruction. The top line and the first line in Obstruction swap places to form the Hexagram of Following. It is clear that the initial nine line originally in Obstruction gets replaced by the top nine. Moving from the top line to the initial line suggests a demotion when viewed from the hexagram, which is why it says \"a change in position of authority.\" Once holding high office, one has now reached the lowest level, mingling with the populace, hence the phrase \"going out to meet others brings success.\" In society, those in high positions always face the potential to become commoners. However, it is precisely in such situations that one can observe the hardships of the people, refine one's life experience, and move to a new level in life. For instance, during the Spring and Autumn Period, Duke Wen of Jin, Chong'er, spent seventeen years in exile, which tempered his will and enriched his experiences, enabling him to return and govern diligently, eventually becoming one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: It binds the young boy, loses the man.  \nThe image says: Binding the young boy, he does not join with others.","interpretation":"Line two: Capture the young slave, but the mature slave escapes.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: To capture the small while the large escapes signifies that one cannot have both.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: Those who receive this line will experience unrest, or fall victim to the schemes of petty people, with disputes continuously occurring.

If so, it would be a loss that outweighs the gain.\n\nThe Commentary says: \"Connecting with the youth, you cannot have both,\" advising that wholeheartedly following young lads will result in losing a virtuous, upright man, as the two are mutually exclusive. Just as King Huai of Chu believed the slanders of the officials Ling Yin Zipep, Shangguan Dafu Jinshang, and the favored concubine Zheng Xiu, leading to the alienation of Qu Yuan, who, to express loyalty, drowned himself in the river. King Huai of Chu’s fate was indeed the outcome of \"Connecting with the youth, losing the husband.\"\n\nThe second yin line occupies an even position, having both the position and central rectitude. However, it faces a dual choice. What's the situation? The situation is like a woman, next to a lowly young lad, but a powerful man (the ninth line of the fifth position) also shows interest in her, so which should she choose? Since the young lad is close, she chooses him. This is \"Connecting with the youth, losing the husband.\" However, the status of the second line is comparable to a nobleman's position — should he exploit the common people to pay tribute to the higher ruler, or love the people as if they are his own children, reducing their taxes and giving lesser tribute to the ruler above? These are the two choices of the second line. It cannot consider both. According to the hexagram, the second line chooses to love the people, for the one who wins people's hearts wins the kingdom."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third position: He ties up the strong man, losing the little child.

In following, there is seeking and obtaining; it is beneficial to dwell in steadfastness.\"\n\nLine three holds a slightly higher position than line two, and thus the desire to ascend is stronger. Line three is likened to a young lady from a wealthy and noble family who doesn't associate with young men from lower social classes, so love does not develop between them. She wishes to interact with someone more noble than herself and thus is drawn to the nine-four above her. The nine-four is positioned above line three, holding a higher status, so naturally, line three must submit to the arrangements of the nine-four in all aspects. Hence, it is said that line three loses the young son (initial nine) and gains the husband (nine-four). However, to maintain this marital relationship well, the woman must adapt to local customs and steadfastly adhere to the path of fidelity, as families of wealth and nobility have many rules. Additionally, line three is the central line of the mutual hexagram of Gen within the Hexagram Yu, symbolizing cessation, which accounts for \"beneficial to dwell in steadfastness.\""},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Following brings capture.

It refers to the following of the Six in the second place. From a relationship perspective, the Six in the third place seeks the Nine in the fourth place, so the Nine in the fourth place gains the Six in the third place and thus \"obtains a reward.\" Moreover, the Nine in the fourth place is in the position of a marquis or a key minister to the king, and the Six in the third place represents the inferior and the petty. The petty seek to associate with the powerful Nine in the fourth place, showering them with gifts and flattery.

Er Hou criticized King Zhou and was killed and made into dried meat. King Wen merely sighed softly, resulting in his imprisonment in the national prison of Youli. \"He is held and bound, then follows\" refers to King Wen's imprisonment.

When faced with these accumulated problems, one finds it difficult to manage.\n\nFirst Six: Faithfulness without constancy leads to chaos and gathering; if one wails, a handful will laugh. Do not worry, proceeding brings no blame.\n\nImage Commentary: Thus, chaos and gathering; its will is chaotic.\n\nThe text means: There is sincerity but no persistence to the end, resulting in chaos and new gatherings. In the midst of chaotic wailing, the gathered people will laugh. There is no need to worry; proceeding will bring no disaster."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: Pulling in good fortune, no blame.

Divining about sacrificial rites, the omen shows that for the spring sacrifice, it is favorable to use prisoners as offerings. \n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: \"Long-term good fortune without misfortune,\" because the yielding line in the second position of the lower hexagram symbolizes a person who firmly upholds the correct path and never changes.","scholar_interpretation":"Auspicious: Those who obtain this line are currently experiencing good fortune.

It embodies the virtues of flexibility, equanimity, and correctness. Although it resonates with the fifth line, the sovereign line, it does not actively seek favor or advancement, but patiently awaits the summon of the fifth line.\n\nThe \"Image\" commentary provides this analysis of the line: \"Withdrawal and humility result in good fortune and no misfortune,\" signifying the unwavering middle path. This indicates that withdrawal and humility lead to good fortune and no calamity because this line occupies a central and appropriate position. At the point of convergence, it neither leans nor is overly aggressive nor excessively conservative; it devoutly follows the principle of the mean without deviation, thereby achieving humility that turns potential misfortune into fortune.\n\nThose who receive this line in divination should understand this principle: in dealing with others, sincerity and trust should be fundamental, rather than focusing on outward declarations or the manner of expression. Like in sacrifice, it is not the quantity of offerings that matters, but rather the sincerity of the person conducting the ritual.\n\nLine 2: Withdrawal and humility lead to good fortune and no misfortune. Sincerity allows for the use of a simple sacrifice.\n\nThe \"Image\" commentary states that gaining fortune through the superior's guidance is because the second line remains centered and righteous without change."},"line_3":{"description":"Line three: Assembling, lamenting, there is no benefit. Proceeding brings no misfortune, though there is slight regret.\n\nThe Image says: Proceeding brings no misfortune as there is compliance above.","interpretation":"Line three: Worry and lament. Obtaining this line in divination is of no benefit. There are no disasters in travel, but there are minor troubles.\n\nThe commentary states: No disasters in travel, because the line three yin position is below the line four yang position, resembling a subordinate being obedient to a superior, behaving with caution.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: For those who obtain this line, there will be unrest at home, harm to relatives, and many misfortunes for the elderly. Officials will find it difficult to maintain peace in their positions, and traveling will be arduous. \n\nExplanation by Taiwan's renowned scholar Fu Peirong: \n\nFortune: The path is ordinary; one must guard against petty people. \n\nWealth: Relocate to another place to avoid misfortune. \n\nHome: Moving residence is advisable; there may be sighs of resentment from partners. \n\nHealth: Discomfort in the chest, attention to excretion is needed.","philosophy":"The meaning of this line is: Due to gathering together and sighing, there is no benefit. However, taking action does not bring disaster, only some minor troubles.\n\nFrom the hexagram perspective, the third line is a yin line occupying a weak position, neither central nor correct, opposing the top line and contrary to the second line below, leaving it isolated and unsupported. However, the third line still has a close and favorable relationship with the fourth and fifth yang lines. If it can humbly submit to them, it can work together without any disaster.\n\nThe \"Image\" section analyzes this line as: \"Going forth brings no misfortune,\" because of the yielding nature above. It points out that \"taking action does not bring disaster,\" as there is a strong yang presence in the upper position, and the yielding yin presence below can always show humility and submission, thereby avoiding possible disasters.\n\nFor those who receive this line, there may be a tendency toward egocentrism or narcissism, making it difficult to fit in at friends' gatherings and find like-minded companions. If one wishes to collaborate with capable individuals, humility and sincerity are needed. Although there may be minor troubles due to personality or other reasons, there will be no major disasters.\n\nFor those who receive this line, attending gatherings may not bring disaster, just minor unpleasantness or inconveniences. Perhaps the banquet seems stingy or petty, causing dissatisfaction.\n\nThe text of the third line: Gathering and sighing, nothing beneficial. Sighing leads to no disaster, only minor discomfort.\nThe \"Image\" says: Going brings no disaster because above is the gentle yielding of the Xun hexagram."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Great fortune, no misfortune.\n\nThe Image says: Great fortune without misfortune, because the position is not appropriate.","interpretation":"Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.\n\nThe commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.","scholar_interpretation":"Flat: Those who receive this line and do not follow the right path will encounter misfortune. Only those of great virtue and integrity can correct their mistakes and attain blessings. Those in official positions must guard against others' suspicion, it is advisable to relinquish higher positions and retreat with courage from swift currents for auspiciousness.\n\nInterpretation by Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:\n\nFortune: Even in times of great prosperity, one's virtues may not match their position.\n\nWealth: Great profits lie ahead, but it is wise to restrain oneself.\n\nDomestic: Prosperous and peaceful; however, there is a disparity in status.\n\nHealth: Strong on the outside but weak within.","philosophy":"Hexagram 45, Fourth Line: The line statement reads: \"Nine in the Fourth Position: Great fortune, no misfortune.\" Explanation of the line statement: The meaning of this line is that only under circumstances of great fortune can disasters be avoided.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram, the Nine in the Fourth Position is below the Kun hexagram, which represents the multitude. The multitude gathers to support the Nine in the Fourth Position, hence \"great fortune.\" The Nine in the Fourth Position is a yang line in a yin position, neither central nor correct. Even if widely admired, it is difficult to achieve great deeds, thus maintaining \"no misfortune\" is all that can be accomplished.\n\nIn the commentary of The Image: \"Great fortune, no misfortune,\" because the position is incorrect. It notes here that \"only under circumstances of great fortune can disasters be avoided,\" as the position is inappropriate and harm could potentially occur at any time. Only when fortune is great can one avoid harm.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it implies being a capable assistant to a leader in a work unit, akin to a minister close to the ruler, garnering substantial support from subordinates due to adept management of interpersonal relationships. However, caution is advised as the leader might not appreciate such scenarios, meaning that trouble can be avoided only under conditions of great fortune. In ordinary circumstances, one might invite scrutiny or trouble from leaders or superiors.\n\nThose who obtain this line have many friends and extensive social connections, but must be cautious as some friends might bring trouble. However, as long as one maintains a correct stance and avoids wrongdoing, danger can be averted.\n\nNine in the Fourth Position: Great fortune, no misfortune. The Image reads: Great fortune, no misfortune because the position is incorrect.\n\nThe text means (in divination) that great fortune allows for the absence of disaster.\n\nThe commentary on The Image explains that in divination, great fortune allows for the absence of disaster, due to the Nine in the Fourth Position being a yang line in a yin position.\n\nThe Nine in the Fourth Position is an upright official, advocating for the impoverished commoners represented by the line at the bottom, extending justice on their behalf. Joined by the Six in the Third Position, which yin and yang complement, it results in great auspiciousness. This auspiciousness is not about gaining benefits but merely avoiding disaster. Why is this? Because the firm nine line occupies an even position, which is an inappropriate position. This means that while being a loyal subject, his upright character leads him to be unreserved in addressing the ruler's faults and errors.\n\nEven though his actions are for the benefit of the ruler, such conduct does not necessarily engender the ruler’s satisfaction with him."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: Gathering with position, no blame.

Do not lightly punish others. Inquiring about long-term fortune or misfortune, the oracle shows that there will be no great regret.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results merely in the absence of disaster because one's talents are low and cannot achieve anything substantial.","scholar_interpretation":"Level: Those who obtain this line will encounter discord with others and face obstacles in their endeavors. Officials will not gain popular support, and their aspirations will not shine.\n\nInterpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Pei-rong:\n\nFortunes: Possessing position and authority requires cultivating virtue.\n\nWealth: Although there is profit, it is necessary to maintain righteousness.\n\nHome: Living with family; can be considered a noble son-in-law.\n\nHealth: The mind is restless, it is best to rest quietly.","philosophy":"The fifth line of the Cui Hexagram reads: \"Nine in the Fifth: Gathering in position, no blame, yet lacking trust; original and perpetual correctness; remorse disappears.\"\n\nInterpretation of the line:\n\"Lacking trust\" refers to a deficiency in credibility.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: When everyone is gathered together, occupying an honorable position incurs no disaster but lacks trust. If one can steadfastly adhere to righteousness and advocate for a pure style, any regret over wrongdoing can be avoided.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth occupies a central and proper position. However, unlike the Nine in the Fourth, which occupies a lower position but gathers people around itself, it overreaches its authority to gather people. This makes the Nine in the Fifth seem less credible among the populace, failing to win over the hearts of the people.\n\nThe \"Image\" explains: \"Gathering in position\" implies that one's aspiration has not yet flourished. It points out: \"When everyone is gathered together, occupying an honorable position incurs no disaster,\" but this does not demonstrate that the aspiration to unite the world or win universal allegiance has been magnified. Therefore, one must cultivate virtue and establish prestige to win over the hearts of the people.\n\nFor those who draw this line, pay attention to the people around you; it may be due to their negative influence that your image is damaged among subordinates or others. You should consider arranging positions at gatherings according to rank and restrain those who are unruly, ensuring they understand the rules from the start, which prevents regrets from occurring later. You must also take care to maintain a good reputation.\n\nFor those who draw this line, the position you hold may attract the opposite sex. You could invite them to meet you, but upon reflection, you decide against it; in the long run, this decision is correct.\n\nNine in the Fifth: Gathering in position, no blame. Lacking trust, original and perpetual correctness, regret disappears.\n\nThe Image says: Gathering in position indicates that the aspiration has not yet flourished.\n\nThe text's meaning: Gathering leads to a position, there is no disaster. Trust is not attained, one must initially and perpetually adhere to the correct path, and there will be no regrets.\n\nThe Image's meaning: Gathering leads to a position, indicating the aspiration has not yet flourished.\n\nAs a ruler of the country, the Nine in the Fifth naturally desires to gather people from all over the world. However, since ascending the throne not long ago, widespread trust from the populace has not yet been achieved. As long as one continually adheres to the correct path, there will be no regrets.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the initial Six and Six in the Third lines gather with the Nine in the Fourth, which repels the Nine in the Fifth due to similar polarities. Thus, only the Six in the Second line gathers with the Nine in the Fifth, leaving the ruler in a somewhat isolated position. By maintaining firmness and righteousness, the ruler can influence the world and eliminate remorse."},"line_6":{"description":"Top Six: Bearing tears and runny nose, there is no blame.\n\nThe Image says: Bearing tears and runny nose indicates not yet being at ease above.","interpretation":"Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: For those who obtain this line, matters are often troublesome and cannot be settled in peace, with potential estrangement between superiors and subordinates, and worries among the young and old; fame and fortune become void.\n\nInterpretation by Taiwan's eminent scholar, Fu Peirong:\n\nFortune: In old age, luck declines, and assistance from others is needed.\n\nWealth: No profits can be gained, but there is fortunate rescue.\n\nHome: Household is unsettled; there will be separations caused by life and death.\n\nHealth: Sorrow leads to illness, so relax your mind.","philosophy":"Hexagram Sui, the sixth line:\n\nLine Text: Upper six: With lamenting and tears, no misfortune. Explanation of the line text: \"Lamenting and tears\": refers to sorrowful sighing and weeping. \"Lamenting and weeping\": tears and snot streaming down. The meaning of this line text is: Though there is sorrowful sighing and weeping, there is no disaster.\n\nFrom the hexagram imagery, the upper six is isolated and unsupported, without a rightful response below. It is beneath the nine in the fifth position, feeling uneasy and discordant, seeing others gather while being alone, thus leading to sighing and weeping.\n\nIn the \"Image\" text, this line is analyzed as: \"With lamenting and tears\", indicating the unease of being in a high position. Here it points out: the \"sorrowful sighing and weeping\" refer to the upper six being aware of its difficult situation, unwilling to rest in a high position. It wishes to gather with others but cannot fulfill that desire, hence the situation is \"without misfortune.\"\n\nFor those who draw this line, it may be because of various objective reasons, preventing them from gathering with colleagues or interacting normally. It may appear that your position is above that of leaders or superiors, leading to isolation and loneliness. For instance, if you are chosen by a superior to supervise the leaders and colleagues of your department, you would find yourself in the same situation as this line. Your display of sadness makes others realize it is not your true intention, so they will not oppose you, and you will not encounter disaster.\n\nEmotionally, those who draw this line might experience turmoil. When the person you love misunderstands you and leaves, initially, she will sigh and weep. Eventually, she will understand that the outcome is not entirely your fault, and her emotions will gradually stabilize. If you wish to reconcile, there is still hope.\n\nUpper six: With lamenting and tears, no misfortune. The Image says: \"With lamenting and tears\", is due to unease in a high position.\n\nThe text means: With lamenting and tears, there is no disaster. The Image commentary means: The lamenting and weeping result from discomfort with being in a high position.\n\nThis upper six is associated with the nine in the fifth position, akin to the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang of the Qing Dynasty. As a woman, she understood that her and Kangxi’s power could not rival the four grand ministers in court. Thus, she was anxious, concerned for Kangxi's safety and the fate of the Qing dynasty.\n\nFrom the hexagram imagery, the upper six line is the topmost line of the Dui trigram, representing water within a marsh, with water rising higher than the ground, inevitably overflowing. Hence, it has the image of \"overflowing tears.\" Apart from being linked to the nine in the fifth position, the upper six has no other corresponding or harmonious line, making its position solitary and weak, prone to being excluded. Therefore, the line text of the upper six is relatively sorrowful, yet without disaster."}},"57":{"general":{"description":"Gentleness. Small success. It is beneficial to have a direction to go.

The origin of this symbol in the Bagua comes from ancient people's observations during their productive activities. They noticed that before a heavy rainstorm, there often came strong winds. In that moment when a mountain storm is about to arrive, with winds filling the building, the sky is filled with layers upon layers of thick, rolling dark clouds, and below the clouds, batches of wind blow. Therefore, \"two\" represents the layers of dark clouds, while \"--\" stands for the gusts of wind beneath the clouds. Together, they form the symbol \"\" to represent wind.\n\nThe first line of the Xun hexagram is a yin line, with two yang lines on top. Xun arises from the transformation of the first line of Qian into yin; Qian represents gold and jade, so doing business can yield triple the profit. Xun is a parallel hexagram to Zhen; Zhen's yang is decisive and restless, hence it is known as a restless hexagram. From the hexagram image, line images, and position of lines in Xun, one can derive meanings such as: externally strong but internally gentle, orderliness, communication, business, profit, penetrating everywhere, seizing opportunities, freshness, speech, good news, recommendation, toil, fickleness, worry and doubt, restlessness, strategy, and indecisiveness."},"line_1":{"description":"First line: Advancing and retreating, it is beneficial for the determination of warriors.  \nThe commentary states: Advancing and retreating indicates doubt in the mind.

The top sixth resembles the peripheral forces of the Shang Dynasty; after King Zhou was destroyed, these peripheral forces were not immediately eradicated. These individuals naturally regarded their status as superior to King Wu, so they did not come to align themselves in support of him. Their danger came from the Duke of Zhou's Eastern Campaign.

Dui represents a marsh, while Kan represents water. There is water in the marsh, and its flow is limited; when there is too much, it overflows beyond the marsh. Therefore, there must be restraint, which is why it is called Jie, meaning moderation. Heaven and earth require moderation to remain ever-renewed, a country needs order to be stable, and individuals require self-discipline to attain perfection.\n\nThe Jie Hexagram follows the Huan Hexagram, as explained in the Sequence of the Hexagrams: \"Things cannot remain forever scattered, hence they are followed by moderation.\" Constant dispersion and scattering are unsuitable, so the focus next turns to moderation. The Jie Hexagram is the opposite of the Huan Hexagram, and they are complementary yet opposite in nature and application.\n\nThe Xiang commentary explains: \"There is water above the marsh; this is Jie. The noble person creates measured rules and deliberates on virtues and conduct.\" It points out that the image of the Dui trigrams, marsh below and water above, represents water above the marsh, symbolizing the control through embankment. Water within the marsh, when full, overflows, and embankments are used to regulate the excess and deficiency of water. A noble person should emulate the principles of the Jie Hexagram, establishing rules and necessary rites and laws as standards of action to moderate people's behavior.\n\nThe Jie Hexagram symbolizes the moderation in all things, conveying the principle of self-restraint, and is considered a highly auspicious hexagram. The Xiang commentary provides the following prognostication for this hexagram: \"When the time comes for favorable change, joy arises; Jiang Taigong ascending the platform to become a deity; at this point, all the deities retreat, and even calamity cannot become harm.\"\n\nAnalyzing the hexagram image of Jie: The upper trigram is Kan, representing water, and the lower trigram is Dui, representing a marsh. Water above the marsh is the image of Jie. Water flows ceaselessly from high to low; however, when it encounters a shallow pit, it accumulates and ceases to flow forward. A marsh is lower than the ground, so when it rains or other waters flow through it, they accumulate there.

However, the initial nine is at the beginning of the Dui hexagram, which represents a young woman. In ancient times, it was encouraged that well-bred women should \"not go past the main gate or the second gate,\" requiring restraint in their actions to display cultured behavior. If one often went out and did not understand self-restraint, their reputation would suffer. Considering the entire hexagram, the initial nine is active but is compared to the reverse compared nine-two, which blocks it, so the upward movement is obstructed, and it is best to stay at home.\n\nIn the Image, this yao is analyzed as: \"Not going beyond the courtyard\" indicates an understanding of when to advance or retreat. This suggests that \"not stepping outside\" implies knowing when to move forward when the way is open and to stop when it is blocked.\n\nFor those who draw this Yao, it is advised not to go out recently and best to stay at home.

In terms of the hexagram image, the nine in the second position is a yang line in a yin position, which is active and eager. Unlike the initial nine, the nine in the second is part of the Zhen hexagram (which includes nine in the second, third, and fourth positions). Zhen represents the eldest son, in contrast to the youngest daughter. In ancient society, women were expected to stay within the confines of the inner and outer gates, while men were supposed to actively venture out, take on responsibilities for their family and society, especially the eldest son of a family, whose responsibilities were even greater. However, the nine in the second position, representing this eldest son, encounters a gentle position, yielding to obstacles of difficulty, and remains at home when he should advance, failing to step out. This leads to a detachment from society and thus, danger arises.\n\nThe \"Image\" analysis for this line states: \"Not leaving the courtyard,\" indicates missing the time of utmost opportunity. It points out that excessive restraint and not stepping beyond the courtyard results in losing appropriate and timely opportunities.\n\nFor those who receive this line, they should break away from their current situation of staying home all the time, step outside, interact with different friends, and gain worldly experience.

However, there is no disaster.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the six in the third position is represented by a yin line in a yang place.

If one persists without change, danger will arise. However, if one regrets the excessive constraint, the danger may disappear.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram's image, the Upper Six is a yin line located in a yielding position, appropriately positioned, but it resides at the highest position of the hexagram and is not central. It fails to maintain centrality, symbolizing the path of extreme constraint that goes beyond moderation. It stubbornly intensifies its constraints without flexibly adjusting, understanding blockage but not openness.\n\nIn the \"Image\" analysis, it interprets this line as: \"Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune,\" indicating that its path has reached an end. It highlights that \"excessive constraint leads to bitterness and will result in danger,\" because excessive constraint inevitably leads to a dead end.\n\nFor someone obtaining this line, you already have a tendency to be excessively constrained. For instance, while frugality is a virtue, if you're saving money to the extent that you don't eat or dress well, this is overconstraint. Do not over-constrain yourself, as living like an ascetic or restricting your talents at work will be detrimental. The urgent task is to find a middle ground between self-indulgence and self-constraint, because excessive constraint is impractical for both oneself and others.\n\nUpper Six: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, but remorse vanishes.\n\nThe Image says: Bitter constraint, persisting in rectitude brings misfortune, because the path has ended.\n\nThe text means that excessive bitter constraint leads to maintaining the right path brings danger, but there is no regret.\n\nThe Image of the text signifies that the danger of excessive constraint is due to reaching a dead end."}},"44":{"general":{"description":"Encountering.

From the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth Place is a yang line occupying the position of the ruler, maintaining balance, capable of encompassing the entire hexagram, stabilizing the overall situation. The \"Image\" explains this line: Nine in the Fifth Place embodies virtue, maintaining balance; blessings descend from heaven, signifying unwavering adherence to one's destiny. This indicates that although occupying the highest position, one can uphold the middle path and maintain a pure heart.

The image explanation is: encountering such confrontation occurs because the top nine is in an extreme position, hence the trouble arises.\n\nThis top nine is akin to the oldest bachelor in a village, who no longer has the opportunity to meet someone gentle and feminine. However, because he is regarded as an elder, he is instead confronted by the younger generation. His first adversary is nine-four, who, having failed to secure a wife, naturally complains to his elder: “Why are you so poor, couldn’t you help me get a wife?” Such words are something nine-four would certainly say. The top nine would also be confronted by nine-five, as nine-five is pressured by the growth of the yin line to retreat to the position of the top nine, in such a case, the top nine can only be filled with worries. But why is there no disaster? Because the top nine is poor and old, in ancient times, dying of old age was considered a joyful event, so the top nine just has to wait for death—how could there be disaster?\n\nIn summary, the misfortune of the sixth line of the Gou Hexagram arises from not heeding the hexagram’s guidance of “do not seek a woman.” However, getting married and having children is something that no one can stop, and the natural cycle of yin growing and yang declining is beyond human control. Therefore, the disaster brought by the “strength of the female” cannot be avoided.\n\nFor those receiving this line, it is important first to understand their real situation clearly.

A person is like a well; if not cleaned in time and freed from the silt, they will be discarded.\n\nInitial Six: The well is muddy and not fit for eating, the old well has no birds.\n\nThe image says: The well is muddy and not fit for eating, indicating a lower state; the old well has no birds, reflects a time of abandonment."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: In the valley of the well, shooting a small fish, the jars are worn-out and leaking.\n\nThe Image says: In the valley of the well, shooting a small fish signifies having no companions.","interpretation":"Nine in the second place: At the mouth of the well, a bow is drawn to shoot small fish in the well.

The commentary states: In the well valley, shoot for fish, there is no interaction.\n\nInterpretation of the line text: Well valley refers to the low-lying area where water collects in the well. Shooting for fish indicates catching fish. Damaged and leaking implies something old and worn out.\n\nFrom the hexagram image, nine in the second place is a yang line in a yin position, which is a mismatch. Being the middle line of the lower trigram, it symbolizes a virtuous and talented person, yet it does not correspond with the fifth nine, but rather aligns closely with the initial six. This suggests that although the person is both talented and virtuous, they do not gain the appreciation of leaders and are viewed as ordinary and inept.\n\nThe Commentary elucidates this line as follows: \"In the well valley, shoot for fish, there is no interaction.\" It states: \"The place where water has collected in the well is perceived as a location for catching fish,\" mainly because there is no response from above, making it difficult to lift the water to the surface for people to drink. Thus, the well's function cannot be fulfilled, and it is reduced to a fish-catching spot. Since the well is incapacitated, the tools for drawing water are also too broken to be useful.\n\nFor someone obtaining this line in divination, it suggests being in a situation where their talents are unrecognized. Despite being highly skilled, they remain unnoticed by leadership and are used like an ordinary employee. It is also possible that they are unable to find a job and have no one willing to employ them. At this point, the person must accept smaller opportunities, much like how well water is not brought up to nourish all, but merely serves as a fish pond. They should begin with small tasks, making modest use of their great talents, and then gradually move upwards, which is better than remaining inactive."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine at the third place: The well is cleaned but not yet used for drinking, causing sorrow in my heart.

However, the third Yang line is in opposition to the fifth Yang line, not receiving its favor. The third Yang line is in correspondence with the sixth Yin line, which laments the potential talent of the third line being unappreciated.\n\nIn the Commentary, the analysis of this line is as follows: \"The well has been cleared, yet none come to draw from it,\" indicating sorrow in action; \"seeking the king's enlightenment,\" leads to receiving blessings. This points out that: \"Although the well is free from mud, still no one comes to draw water,\" suggesting that despite one's active drive and desire to serve the public good, these good intentions go unrecognized, resulting in a sorrowful end to well-meaning actions. The hope for an enlightened ruler is expressed, shifting from the well to human affairs, anticipating the emergence of a sage-like ruler who appreciates talents, eager to select and employ capable individuals, so all may enjoy the benefits that come from it.\n\nFor those who draw this line, seeking employment often results in setbacks.

It has already advanced to the upper trigram, possessing conditions for reaching communication. The fourth line supports the fifth line above and is supported by the third line below.

In this hexagram, it is a combination of different trigrams, with the lower trigram being \"坎\" (Water) and the upper trigram being \"震\" (Thunder). \"震\" represents thunder and movement; \"坎\" represents water and danger. Danger is within, movement is outside. The main idea of this hexagram is that after the harsh winter, when people hear the first clap of thunder from the sky, they know that the ice on the ground has melted and spring has arrived. This signifies that all things have been released from the harsh winter conditions where life is unsuitable. \"In the severe winter, heaven and earth are stagnant, absolute stillness eventually brings movement.

Explanation of the statement: The word \"means\" is an interjection. The meaning of this line statement is: A noble person will only have good fortune after eliminating obstacles; simultaneously, only in this way can one earn the submission of petty people.\n\nFrom the hexagram's image, the fifth line occupies the middle position of the upper hexagram, symbolizing the combination of kindness and authority. The yin line sits in a yang position, portraying traits of gentleness and flexibility, capable of approaching virtuous ministers, yet also showing trustworthiness towards the petty. On one hand, employing vigorous noble people to eradicate treacherous pests, while on the other hand, using sincerity to pacify and reform petty people, offering them chances to correct themselves, thus resolving conflicts.\n\nThe Image explains this line: The noble person has liberation, and the petty retreats. Here it indicates: Only by removing obstacles can the noble person earn the confidence of the petty. The emphasis here is on the principle of positivity overcoming negativity; maintaining one's integrity, and the malice will naturally recede or disappear.\n\nFor those receiving this line in divination, in dealing with subordinates at work, one should employ capable individuals while not abandoning or punishing the petty, instead using methods of edification to transform them.\n\nThe noble person finds liberation, auspicious; gains trust from the petty. Image says: The noble person achieves liberation, and the influence of the petty retreats.\n\nThe scripture's meaning is: The noble person breaks free from difficulties, leading to auspiciousness; uses integrity to inspire the petty. The Image's interpretation: The noble person obtains liberation and the petty force declines.\n\nThe fifth line resides at a position of honor, akin to a ruler. However, it sits at the top line of the K'an hexagram of the mutual Gua, suggesting danger and constraint. But who can bind a ruler? Generally speaking, none would dare to do so. Yet, some petty individuals huddle around a ruler, like ropes binding him. How can the ruler escape such a predicament? Only by drawing close to virtuous ministers and distancing from the petty can he achieve liberation. The fifth line achieves this, aligning with the fourth line, a virtuous minister, and resonating with the second line, another virtuous figure, thus dissolving the petty individuals' constraints. Freeing oneself from such constraints is indeed auspicious. By doing so, the ruler essentially reforms the petty, transforming them into noble persons."},"line_6":{"description":"Top line.

Hawk: A fierce and greedy bird. Wall: Refers to the city wall.\nThe meaning of this line is: To completely eliminate internal troubles is like the duke using an arrow to shoot the vicious bird that is entrenched on the high city walls, hitting it in one shot, resulting in nothing unfavorable. \nThe principle this line conveys is that one should take decisive measures against evil.\n\nThe line is a yin line positioned in a soft position, well-placed, and it is the highest position within this hexagram. This line is the conclusion of the 解卦, indicating that all difficulties have been resolved. The hawk refers to cruel birds, symbolizing renegade ministers and traitors causing internal strife. The top six line suggests dealing with ambitious, unruly ministers and traitors who are not in alignment, just like shooting down a hawk on a high wall, resulting in everything being favorable.\n\nIn the commentary \"象\": \"The duke uses an arrow to shoot the hawk,\" signifies resolving rebellion. It points out: \"Like a duke using an arrow to shoot the vicious bird perched on the high city walls,\" the sovereign should thereby resolve the difficulties caused by rebellion and disorder.\n\nIf you obtain this line in divination, it indicates conflicts arising in your career or family, originating from leadership within the company or family members. In such situations, you must make firm decisions, face the issues bravely, and resolve the conflicts swiftly without hesitation.\n\nText of the line from classical commentary: \"Top six: The duke uses an arrow to shoot the hawk on the high wall, hitting it, and there is nothing unfavorable.\"\n\nInterpretation from the commentary \"象\": \"The duke uses an arrow to shoot the eagle, to resolve the threat of the defiant.\" \n\nThe meaning of the classical text is: The monarch shoots the great eagle from the high wall, hitting it, with no misfortunes.\n\nThe interpretation from the commentary \"象\" suggests: The duke shoots the great eagle, to remove the threat of those who defy authority.\n\nThe top six is at the highest line of the 解卦, hence referred to as \"high wall.\" Why does the duke stand on the high wall to shoot the great eagle? It is to show the people of the world. The duke shooting the great eagle metaphorically signals the conquest of rebellious vassal states. The campaign against rebellious states is to achieve the unity and peace of the kingdom, using warfare to eliminate the threat of war. For a country, it is necessary to use both subtle strategies that neutralize small miscreants and military force to eliminate the threat of rebellion. This represents both civil governance and military preparedness. The duke’s successful suppression of rebellion naturally results in no unfavorable outcomes."}},"14":{"general":{"description":"Great Possession.

The upper hexagram is Li, which represents fire; the lower is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is in the sky, illuminating all things, and all people comply and prosper in accordance with celestial timing, leading to great achievement.\n\n\"Great Possession,\" comprised of Fire above Heaven, derives its name from the following connotations: Qian symbolizes strength and vigor, while Li signifies brightness. Through vigorous actions that pursue brightness, success is highly hopeful, leading to attainment. Qian, representing strength and vigor, resides in the inner hexagram, signifying beauty within the heart; Li, symbolizing brightness, is the outer hexagram, signifying that external methods are open and honorable. Possessing this consistency of inner and outer virtue is the true essence of Great Possession.\n\nThe hexagram \"Great Possession\" follows the hexagram \"Sameness with People,\" which is explained in the order of hexagrams as: \"Those who are of the same mind will naturally amass things, hence followed by 'Great Possession.'\" By finding those with shared aspirations and working together with unified effort, resources naturally become abundant, leading to Great Possession.\n\nThe Image says: \"Fire above Heaven, the image of 'Great Possession'; the Superior Person curtails evil and promotes good, following heavenly mandates.\" This means that the hexagram image of \"Great Possession\" is represented by Qian (Heaven) below and Li (Fire) above, an image of fire in the sky. The flame hangs high in the sky, symbolizing the sun illuminating all creation, a fully bright world leading to abundant harvests and \"Great Possession.\" \"Following heaven's natural order\" implies submission to the natural course. The enlightened person during \"Great Possession\" only needs to comply with the \"Heavenly Way\"; there is no need to overly worry about one's fate. During this time, the Superior Person must stop evil, praise all good deeds, follow heavenly dictates, and act in accordance with celestial principles to safeguard the lives of all beings. Therefore, there is an emphasis on blocking evil, promoting good, and acting naturally according to divine direction.\n\nThe hexagram Great Possession reveals the principle of conforming to celestial and seasonal timing, an auspicious hexagram. It symbolizes great harvest, wealth, and prosperity from the very beginning. When consulting this hexagram, it is an auspicious sign, foretelling success in pursuing official posts and wealth, with any fluctuation eventually resulting in fulfillment. The Image interprets the hexagram thus: felling trees and catching sparrows ensures stability, disputes naturally dissipate, and marriage and partnership may carry certain efforts, while seeking the lost is an escape unfulfilled.\n\nThe hexagram of Great Possession is characterized by the upper hexagram Li as fire and the lower hexagram Qian as heaven, resulting in the image of fire reaching up to the sky. As the proverb says, \"Individuals gather kindling for a high flame,\" symbolizing how people gather around a fire to form the \"Sameness with People\" hexagram; when people unite, each contributing to the fire, it allows the flames to reach the sky. This illustrates that only through unity can greater strength and rewards be attained. Additionally, Li is the sun, and Qian is heaven, giving Great Possession the image of the sun at its zenith. The noon sun is the brightest and hottest, thus in ancient times, midday signified the peak of things."},"line_1":{"description":"Initial Nine: There is no interaction to cause harm, nor is there fault; if difficulties arise, there will be no blame.  \nThe Image says: In \"Great Possession,\" the Initial Nine signifies no interaction to cause harm.","interpretation":"At the beginning of nine: Do not harm each other, and there will be no disaster.

This line is a yang line in a firm position, proper in its place and gaining authority. It is repelled by \"nine four\" due to similar natures and does not correspond; however, it also symbolizes that there are no private emotions between them, embodying impartiality and broadness in social interactions. Thus, it is described as interacting with people outside the door. Although it hasn't reached the degree of great unity described in the hexagram statement as \"in the countryside,\" it has surpassed the narrow kinship relations within a single gate. With such wide-ranging interactions, there will naturally be no errors.\n\nIf you act with a selfless heart, without bias or favoritism, you will be able to find like-minded people to pioneer endeavors together. Leaving one's home to gather with kindred spirits, how could there be any mistake? Having difficulties, seeking help from the crowd outside, how could there be any mistakes? Stepping outside one's home, leaving one's small circle, going among the people, how could there be any mistakes? This is \"associating with people at the gate, without fault.\" In ancient China, typically when faced with major issues that the king could not resolve, a royal notice would be posted to invite capable people from across the land to solve it.\n\nSuch royal notices were generally posted outside the noon gate or the city gate, allowing more people to see them. This is the meaning of \"associating with people at the gate.\" Therefore, \"associating with people at the gate\" implies both seeking assistance from the world's wise individuals and integrating with the common people. Achieving these, certainly, there will be no error."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: The great cart is used for carrying.

Those holding idle official positions will be heavily utilized.  \nLuck: Currently encountering good fortune, everything proceeds smoothly.  \nWealth: Profits can be gained both domestically and internationally.  \nResidence: Relocation is possible.  \nHealth: Seeking medical treatment away from home and winning lawsuits.","philosophy":"Clan: refers to a clan or kinship group. Narrowness: means narrow-mindedness or pettiness.\n\nFrom the hexagram image perspective, the second line, belonging to a yin line in a yin position, is in a proper position and is balanced and upright, corresponding with the \"fifth nine,\" an interaction of yin and yang, which is typically a favorable symbol. However, in the case of this \"Fellowship with Men\" hexagram, such correspondence indicates the presence of personal affections or self-interest. This hexagram is meant to articulate the ideal world of universal harmony, requiring just and selfless interactions, so the relationship between the second line and the fifth nine becomes unfavorable and inappropriate. It's akin to interacting only within one's kin or same-surnamed clan, which harbors self-interest. Such a clan-centered and homogeneous attitude, while not outright wrong, doesn't merit praise either. This line suggests the need to break away from clan-based thinking, expanding one's circle of friends and scope of interactions. Solely bonding with people of the same lineage might lead to drawbacks and difficulties in action. One should adopt a broader vision and engage more with the outside world.\n\nThe Commentary states: \"Fellowship with men in the clan\" implies a narrow path. This teaches us that an inability to unite people from all walks of life is a root cause of trouble. Therefore, if you wish to accomplish things, do not rely solely on people from your kinship group. Especially in businesses run by husbands and wives or family-owned enterprises, mishandling these relationships might lead to mutual suspicion over interests, thereby harming familial bonds.\n\nBreaking this boundary and uniting people at all levels is more beneficial for business endeavors."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: The noble one succeeds with the Son of Heaven, but the inferior person cannot achieve it.  \nThe Image says: The noble one succeeds with the Son of Heaven; this harms the inferior person.","interpretation":"Nine in the third place: The Son of Heaven hosts a feast for the dukes and marquises.

Explanation of the hexagram statement: \n\n\"Laying in ambush\" refers to hiding and concealing forces, intending to fight but not revealing oneself. \"Troops\" refers to the army and soldiers. \"Thickets\" refers to wild grass and dense forest. \"Ascending\" means climbing up. \"Hills\" refers to mounds or hills.\n\nThe meaning of the hexagram statement is: hiding the troops within dense forests and thickets, occupying nearby strategic high points to keep watch, and for three years, not daring to rashly send out the troops.\n\nConsidering the relationship with other lines, the nine in the third place can be metaphorically described like this: the six in the second place is a yin line representing a woman, while the nine in the third place is a yang line in a yang position, at the very top of the lower trigram, representing a man. In the entire hexagram, the most dominant is the nine in the fifth place, which is also a yang line in a yang position, at the position of the sovereign, representing a man stronger than the nine in the third place. The nine in the third place is the leader of a small country. A stronger external leader is interested in a beautiful woman within the territory of the nine in the third place. To please the stronger external leader, it is intended to send this beautiful woman as a peace offering; however, the nine in the third place, upon seeing the woman himself, forcefully keeps her to marry her. Concerned that the opposing leader might attack in anger, and knowing he is no match for the opposing leader, he keeps the troops hidden in the woods and thickets, constantly vigilant. Fortunately, the allied country did not attack, and disaster was avoided.\n\nThose receiving this hexagram should be careful to maintain relations with the outside world, and not, for the sake of personal interest, strain relations with allies to the point of tension, thus exhausting their energy and bringing fear and unease to themselves.\n\nTo hide troops among the thickets and for three years not dare to engage the enemy directly is indeed cautious. However, caution avoids major mistakes; although lying in ambush among the thickets is uncomfortable, it allows preservation of strength. This might still be referring to the campaign of King Gaozong against the Gui Fang tribe. Gui Fang was a tribe in ancient northwest China. Historically, the northern tribes have been brave and bellicose, so King Gaozong’s initial expedition must have been unfavorable. What to do when the enemy is too strong? Only wait for the right opportunity. Keep troops hidden among the thickets, study new battle strategies, and search for the chance to annihilate the enemy at one blow. \"Not advancing for three years\" essentially means it begins after three years, suggesting that the enemy is defeated after three years. This is the strategy and tactic necessary to face a strong enemy."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: Not relying on one's great force, no misfortune.\n\nThe Image says: Not relying on one's great force, no misfortune, this signifies clear and distinct judgment.","interpretation":"Nine in the fourth place: Employing a male shaman to pray for rain, while the drought is severe, there is no disaster.  \nThe Xiang commentary says: Opposing bad people and bad deeds incurs no disaster, because one is clear in investigation and discernment.","scholar_interpretation":"Level: For those who obtain this line, it is suitable to maintain constancy and thereby avoid harm, though eye-related ailments may occur.

It is like when one climbs up the city wall ready to engage in battle with the enemy but decides to retreat instead, leading to a fortunate outcome.\n\nThe Image says: \"He climbs up his city wall,\" indicating inability to attack. The \"good fortune\" is due to being confounded and then turning back. This teaches people that preparing to attack the enemy by climbing the city wall but ultimately not attacking is because one realizes that such aggression is not righteous. Good fortune is achieved when, in times of confusion, one awakens in time and turns back to act in a rightful manner."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: There is confidence and interconnectedness, awe-inspiring and auspicious.\n\nThe Image: \"Confidence and interconnectedness\" signifies sincerity that inspires determination; the auspiciousness of \"awe-inspiring\" lies in being easygoing without defenses.","interpretation":"Nine in the fifth position: The invading enemy is tightly bound and severely punished; it is auspicious.  \nThe commentary states: His honesty and sincerity are evident, as he demonstrates his intentions through integrity.

The great leader’s encounter suggests that heaven unknowingly brings a supreme meeting, indicating overcoming challenges. \n\nThis speaks of initially weeping loudly, indicating an inner righteousness and sincerity, anxious over unknown outcomes of battles; the army encounters like-minded allies and eventually achieves victory, leading to laughter. \n\nWhen seeking like-minded individuals, there will certainly be some resistance; they are not easily found, and you may suffer deeply for it. However, as long as you do not give up and overcome these obstacles, you will eventually achieve your goal and smile. \n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, when negotiations with partners are at an impasse, a third party might unexpectedly appear, turning the situation in your favor.

","philosophy":"Hexagram Tong Ren, Line Six: Line statement: \"Upper Nine: Fellowship with men out in the suburbs, no regret.\"\n\nThis Upper Nine is the last line of the Tong Ren hexagram. It is a yang line in a soft position, misplaced, and lacking in influence. Moreover, it is in opposition to the third nine, and too far from the second six. There is a group of yang lines in between acting as a barrier. If it were to force a connection with the second six, it would inevitably expend too much energy and become embroiled in disputes. Therefore, there is no need to strive for an optimal state; it is better to forge alliances nearby. By forming associations with those in the \"suburbs,\" one can live peacefully and without conflict.\n\nThe imagery says, \"Fellowship with men out in the suburbs,\" indicating that the original intention has not been realized with clarity. Here, it points out that \"gathering people in the outskirts\" clearly signifies not achieving one's original aspirations.\n\nFor those who draw this line in a divination, it indicates that you wish to accomplish something or connect with important or like-minded people. However, there are too many who desire to connect with this person, leading to internal conflict. You, too, lack the opportunity to form a connection, so it would be wiser to connect with those who are more easily approachable.\n\nThe Upper Nine is situated on the outermost edge of the Qian hexagram; Qian symbolizes the outskirts. Therefore, this hexagram has the statement of \"Fellowship with men out in the suburbs.\" Indeed, in any society, there are those who fail to achieve their ambitions. Those who are capable but unfulfilled can only retreat into simplicity; such people may be referred to as hermits. The Upper Nine is a hermit who, although unfulfilled, can live alongside other hermits calmly in a remote region. Because they can maintain composure without excessive desires, they experience no regret or remorse. This is akin to what Zhuge Liang wrote in his \"Admonitions to his Nephews\": \"One should hold high and far-reaching aspirations, admire the wise men of the past, resolve desires, discard stagnation, so that the aspirations, though close, are upheld with clarity, and felt deeply; endure hardship and flexibility, dismiss minutiae, widely seek advice, eliminate idleness and pettiness, and even if there are delays or troubles, what harm does it pose to noble intent, or fear of not achieving success.\" Being able to accomplish these things amidst simplicity, one will naturally be capable of advancing when advantageous and holding their ground when necessary."}},"54":{"general":{"description":"The Marrying Maiden.

The ancients regarded a girl's marriage as having a place to belong, much like returning to one's home.\n\n\"The Image\" interprets this hexagram: \"There is thunder over the lake, symbolizing Guimei. The noble person uses this to ensure an everlasting harmonious union, preventing the deterioration of the couple's relationship.\" Here it points out: The hexagram of Guimei consists of Dui (lake) below and Zhen (thunder) above. Dui represents the youngest daughter and Zhen represents the eldest son, symbolizing the marriage of a young girl. The noble person should always maintain harmony in the relationship, ensuring a lifelong union, preventing the disruption of the marital relationship.\n\nThe Guimei Hexagram symbolizes marriage, conveying the principle of establishing a family and prospering one's career, making it an unfavorable hexagram. \"The Image\" explains this hexagram: Seeking fish should be done in the water, seeking it in the trees goes against logic, full of difficulties and unable to achieve success, resulting in unfruitful labor and ordinary fortune."},"line_1":{"description":"First Nine: Returning maiden with a younger sister, the lame can walk, expedition is auspicious.\n\nThe Image says: Returning maiden with a younger sister signifies constancy.

The meaning of this line statement is: The elder sister marries as the main wife, while the younger sister accompanies her as a concubine, both serving the same husband. Just like a person with a limp, although unsteady, they assist each other, following the rules and obtaining auspiciousness in progress.\n\nFrom the hexagram image, the First Nine is located at the bottom of the hexagram, at the lowest position, and cannot gain the favor of the ruler's representative in the hexagram, the Sixth Five. This is not the position of the main wife. The First Nine is inversely related to the Second Nine, and the Second Nine aligns with the Sixth Five. If the First Nine is unwilling to become a concubine, it will be difficult to find a desired husband. Recognizing the bleak prospects for its future, it chooses to compromise and marry as a concubine. By adhering to formality and propriety, it is still auspicious.\n\n\"The Image\" analyzes this line: \"Marrying maiden as a secondary wife,\" represents constancy; \"Limping yet able to walk, signifies perpetual auspiciousness.\" It indicates: \"The elder sister marrying as the main wife and the younger sister as a concubine\" is a normal situation in marriage; \"Like a limping person, although unsteady, by assisting each other and acting with propriety,\" suggests that even from the status of a concubine, by supporting and caring for the husband, one can still obtain auspiciousness.\n\nThose who receive this line of divination should understand this principle: knowing that the treatment received is unjust, yet willingly accepting it with a humble attitude, can lead to auspicious results.

Although there is internal discontent, it can adhere to the middle path. It's like a young woman eager to marry, yet she finds herself with a less-than-satisfactory husband. Despite harboring resentment, she must turn a blind eye and maintain this mindset to stay on the righteous path.\n\nThe commentary from \"Xiang\" explains this line: \n“It benefits those with grievances to maintain integrity,” indicating that it remains unchanged and constant. It suggests that this way of thinking benefits those who hold grievances in maintaining righteousness, as it allows adherence to enduring rules.\n\nFor those receiving this line in a reading, there may be career-related setbacks. You might feel discontent towards your leaders or superiors, whose actions you find disdainful. However, you very much need this job. Therefore, you should turn a blind eye to your leaders' or superiors' shortcomings, perform your duties well, complete your responsibilities, and simply earn your wage.

This indicates a woman of noble birth, who is both virtuous and talented, choosing not to marry hastily but waiting for a favorable opportunity.\n\nThe \"Image\" text explains this line as: \"The intention to delay is to act with patience.\" This points out that missing the opportunity to marry is in order to wait for a better time to come.\n\nFor one divining this line, although you have reached the age suitable for marriage, you have delayed because you haven't found the right partner.

The insight provided by the Initial Six Yao Ci is: Being weak and yielding, one should stop upon encountering danger and wait for the right opportunity. The Initial Six is at the beginning of the Jian Hexagram, occupying a low position with a yin line which is weak and incorrect, situated at the initial position of the lower Gen (stopping) trigram. Advancing will inevitably fall into the danger of the upper Kan (abyss) trigram, hence \"advancing encounters obstruction.\" If one recognizes the time and withdraws upon seeing danger, they can gain praise.\n\nIn the Image it is explained as, \"Advancing encounters obstruction, retreating brings praise,\" it is advisable to wait.

To those consulting this Yao, if you realize there are difficulties in advancing, temporarily retreating to wait is a wise choice.\n\nThe Image's meaning is: Advancing meets danger, returning earns honor, indicating one should await the opportunity. As the lowest line of the Jian Hexagram and a soft line in an unfit position, it lacks the strength to overcome obstacles. Initial Six corresponds with Nine Four, which is the lower line of the upper Kan Hexagram at the brink of danger. This means that although Initial Six lacks the ability to overcome obstacles, it has strong foresight and retreats before reaching the edge of danger.

However, it is evidently of weak disposition, lacking in capability. It corresponds directly to the king in the Nine in the fifth place line of this hexagram, indicating utmost loyalty. While the Nine in the fifth place is trapped in difficulty, the Six in the second place makes an effort to help. Though lacking the condition to overcome the difficulty, the attempt to aid places oneself in peril. Yet, understanding this is not for personal gain but to support the royal family, one does not hesitate to face any hardship.\n\nThe Image's explanation of this line states: \"The minister faces difficulties,\" ultimately without blame. It indicates that \"the minister strives amidst danger to save the king from difficulty,\" ultimately not receiving reproach.\n\nAlthough the Six in the second place does not possess the ability to save the king, such qualities are still commendable. He does not avoid danger for personal safety but willingly faces challenges for the nation, even if he fails, he will not be blamed, nor will he self-reproach.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, when unable to advance, they should diligently do the work at hand.

It corresponds with the Nine in the fifth place line, with both possessing upright virtue, thus committing no mistakes; however, they face significant challenges. Whence do these challenges arise? Observing the hexagram, the Nine in the fifth place resides in the middle position of the upper trigram Kan, which symbolizes danger and trouble, hence the implication of being trapped in difficulty.

","philosophy":"The third line of the Jian hexagram: Line statement: Nine in the third: Going forward is difficult, coming back is the return. Explanation of the line statement: \"Return\" is the same as \"returning.\" The meaning of this line statement is: going forward leads to disaster, so one returns. The message from this nine in the third position is: the situation shows no sign of improvement; advancing leads to danger, whereas returning leads to something attainable. From the hexagram perspective, the nine in the third line is a yang line in a strong position, at a point of being able to advance or retreat. It corresponds to the top line, so there is an intention to advance. However, what lies ahead is the upper trigram Kan, which represents danger, hence the retreat. The \"Image\" explains this line as: \"Going leads to difficulty, coming back leads to return,\" which means there is joy within. Here it points out: \"Going forward leads to disaster and then returning.\" Such internal strength is bound to attach itself to oneself. The nine in the third is at the top of the lower trigram, below it are two yin lines. The nine in the third is their pillar. In times of difficulty represented by the Jian hexagram, the yin lines cannot stand alone and must rely on the strength of the nine in the third. Initially intending to advance, the nine in the third encounters obstacles and returns, making the two yin lines very happy and willing to attach themselves. If one obtains this line in divination, if you find that your career encounters obstacles, further development is very difficult; it is better to return home and reunite with your family in happiness. The meaning of the Image statement is: going forward into danger and then returning indicates that the two yin lines of the inner trigram are pleased with the return of the nine in the third. The nine in the third position is in the middle of the lower inner hexagram Kan, so it implies being trapped in danger. What to do? He wishes to escape the danger but encounters even greater peril. Because in front of him is the upper Kan hexagram of the Jian hexagram, he has to retreat. Since the nine in the second is the top line of the lower section Gèn, he halts in the face of even greater danger. It's like a man becoming increasingly poor, leaving home to bring wealth, only to encounter great obstacles and return home to continue living in poverty. However, his return makes his two wives very happy because, although poor, the family can still be reunited."},"line_4":{"description":"Line four: Proceeding is difficult, but coming together is possible.\n\nThe Image says: Proceeding is difficult, but coming together is possible; it signifies being in the proper position and remaining true.","interpretation":"Six in the fourth position: When going out, the journey is difficult, but upon returning, there is a carriage to ride.

","philosophy":"Hexagram Jian, the fourth line, Line Statement: Sixty-Four: Advancing is difficult, retreat is collaborative. Explanation of the Line Statement: \"Collaborative\" refers to forming alliances. The meaning of this line statement is: If you proceed, you will encounter obstacles. Only by joining forces with others can you possibly overcome crises. The insight from the Ninth Three line is: In times of difficulty, one should establish a united front. From the hexagram image, the Sixty-Four is a yin line in a yielding position, unable to overcome obstacles on its own. To overcome them, it must seek to unite with other forces. The Sixty-Four is closely aligned with the Ninth Five and harmonizes with the Ninth Three, hence it can receive help to overcome difficulties. The \"Image\" analysis says: \"Advancing is difficult, retreat is collaborative,\" because the position indeed justifies it. \"Only by forming alliances with other forces can one possibly overcome crises,\" indicates that the position of this line dictates such actions. The lesson from this line is similar to the strategy of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period. After Liu Bei's death, Shu suffered losses and faced Wei's pressing forces, at a critical survival point. During this national difficulty, Zhuge Liang first considered establishing a united front, restoring the alliance with Eastern Wu. Through the establishment of the united front, they resisted Wei's aggression against Shu, allowing Zhuge Liang to focus on the southern campaign, capturing Meng Huo seven times, launching northern expeditions, making six attacks on Qishan, achieving a series of victories.

The Nine in the Fifth is a yang line situated in a firm position, located in the middle of the upper trigram Kan, which represents danger, within the hexagram Jian. It is in the depths of difficulty, hence called \"great difficulty\"; at this time, there are loyal ministers like the one represented by the second six, who earnestly strive to resolve difficulties.\n\nIn the \"Image\" section, it analyzes in this way: \"Great difficulty; friends come\" signifies acting with moderation. It points out that amidst extreme difficulty, like-minded individuals come to help overcome the crisis, indicating an ability to adhere to the righteous path and act according to principles, thus attracting many to assist.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the Nine in the Fifth is a yang line and occupies a central and correct position, embodying the virtue of dynamic balance and integrity. Therefore, it possesses the ambition to relieve the people’s distress and aid in difficulty. Even when trapped in peril, it does not abandon the principle of overcoming adversity, thus receiving help from many.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, their career faces immense difficulties, but during such times, it is crucial to stick to the righteous path and avoid illegal or unreasonable actions.

Explanation: Abundant means plentiful.\n\nThe meaning of this line is: Moving forward encounters obstacles, returning brings abundance. Doing so will bring good fortune; it is beneficial for meeting a great person.\n\nThe top six is a yielding line in a yin position and is at the peak of the hexagram, impossible to go further. Forcefully moving forward not only brings no benefits but actually increases difficulties. If one returns and allies with the third and fifth lines, with the support of these two firm lines, the great achievement of overcoming difficulties can be accomplished. Therefore, the line words say \"returning is abundant.\" The dilemma of the six lines is completely resolved, hence the result is \"auspicious.\"\n\nIn the \"Image,\" this line is analyzed as follows: \"Going is difficult, returning is abundant,\" indicating an inner resolve; \"beneficial to see a great person,\" means following the noble. It points out that \"moving forward encounters obstacles, returning brings abundance\" is because the key is to first unite with various inner forces to jointly overcome difficult times. \"Beneficial to see a great person\" indicates that one should follow a noble leader to achieve successes.\n\nThose who obtain this line might encounter difficulties when moving forward, feeling like their career is at a dead end. At this time, it is wise to retreat, which might bring unexpected gains. Next, you should make friends and seek to meet influential figures, whose help will aid you in overcoming challenges.\n\nTop six: going is difficult, returning is abundant; auspicious; beneficial to see a great person.\n\nThe Image says: \"Going is difficult, returning is abundant,\" showing an inner resolve. Beneficial to see a great person, as one follows the noble.\n\nThe scripture means: moving forward meets obstacles, returning has great achievements, auspicious, beneficial to meet a great person.\n\nThe explanation of the Image says: moving forward meets obstacles, returning has great achievements, is the result of the top six line working collaboratively with others. Beneficial to meet a great person indicates the top six line follows a noble leader.\n\nThe top six is at the extreme of difficulties. Its challenges are not of mountains and rivers but of reaching a dead end, with no path forward. What to do? The only option is to retreat, retreat to get through the current difficulties with everyone else. The top six corresponds with the third line and aligns with the fifth line, so it has the intention to return. Upon returning, it can align with the fifth line, hence \"beneficial to see a great person.\" The good fortune of the top six lies in being able to retreat when there's no way forward. It is similar to a flood in a tribe: the top six escapes the flood, but finds no road ahead despite the absence of flood. In such a situation, it returns to the disaster area, uniting with everyone to resist the disaster. As the saying goes, \"many hands make light work,\" the return of the top six adds to the strength of resisting the disaster, and thereby brings good fortune."}},"23":{"general":{"description":"There is Splitting Apart.

Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan: Fortune: The time and fortune are not favorable; maintain peace of mind and your place. Wealth: Profit from exports, exploiting others' wealth. Home: Do not leave your own home; buying a temporary residence is possible. Health: The soul is not attached, be extremely careful.","traditional":"This hexagram is composed of dissimilar trigrams (with Earth below and Mountain above). Five yin lines are below, with one yang line above, representing an abundance of yin and a solitary yang; a high mountain rests on the earth. Both signify the concept of peeling away, hence it is known as the \"Hexagram of Splitting Apart.\" In this hexagram, yin flourishes while yang declines, metaphorically indicating a time when petty people gain influence and virtuous people are in distress, leading to the ruin of enterprises.\n\nGreat Image: The mountain resting upon the earth symbolizes mountains and stones collapsing to the ground, with five yin lines pressuring one yang, causing justice to be damaged.\n\nFortunes: Misfortune surrounds you, suggesting the need to reorganize. Avoid being overconfident to prevent being implicated by women and petty individuals.\n\nCareer: The times are unfavorable and driven by great trends, meaning an individual can only adapt to situations and pause actions, observing changes without taking risks.

Kun signifies Earth, below the mountain; Gen signifies Mountain, above the Earth. The mountain stands on the Earth, enduring constant wind, rain, lightning, and sun, leading to continuous erosion.\n\nFrom the entire hexagram structure, five yin lines are below and one yang line is above, indicating that yin prevails while yang is isolated; a high mountain rests on the Earth. The mountain is eroded by wind and rain, its original beauty damaged, and its fallen debris presses upon the Earth, ruining the land's inherent beauty, symbolizing destruction to the Earth. Therefore, the Bo hexagram has a destructive nature. This hexagram signifies the dominance of petty people over virtuous ones, bringing hardship to the righteous and the downfall of enterprises. However, the I Ching is rich with dialectical thought and the philosophy of development and change. If the eroded material fills a pit on the ground, or if the ground is barren and the fallen debris enriches the soil, it becomes a beneficial situation.\n\nThe Bo hexagram follows after the Bi hexagram, as stated in the Sequence of Hexagrams: \"Once the embellishment reaches its peak, enjoyment exhausts it, thus it is followed by Bo. Bo signifies stripping away.\" After the colorful adornment of the Bi hexagram, fulfillment reaches its end, followed by erosion.\n\nThe Bo hexagram succeeds the grand symbolism of the Bi hexagram and discusses the principle that what is prosperous must eventually decline. From the first to the fourth line, this meaning is prevalent. The fifth line discusses some remediative actions taken in response to decline, and the final line speaks of the effects achieved after these measures.\n\nThe Bo hexagram belongs to the category of lower hexagrams. The Commentary on the Image describes this hexagram with an analogy: “A magpie finds itself lodging in the woods late at night, unaware there is already an eagle inside. Although they share the same place, animosity arises. If this hexagram appears, troubles will be less severe.”\n\nThe name of this hexagram, Bo, comes from the definition in the Shuowen: \"Bo means to split.\" The Guangya explains it as \"Bo, to separate.\" Clearly, the inherent meaning of the character \"Bo\" refers to removing the surface of an object, implying peeling, shedding, or falling off. Decorative elements do not last forever; they ultimately peel away, much like needing to renovate a house when the wall surface peels after a few years. Thus, below the Bi hexagram is the Bo hexagram. The Sequence of Hexagrams states: \"Once embellishment is complete, enjoyment exhausts it, hence followed by Bo.\" The Miscellaneous Hexagrams states: \"Bo, decay.\" Both the Sequence of Hexagrams and Miscellaneous Hexagrams speak of societal change. In prosperous times, people pursue excessive ornamentation, much like decay, gradually eroding the prosperity and leading to decline."},"line_1":{"description":"Stripping at the start involves the sixth line.

With the entire bed leg damaged, the outcome is bound to be dire.\n\nThe insight from this line is not to overlook small errors or issues, as they can lead to greater ruin, like how a small ant hole can collapse a dike. Pay attention when the erosion begins at the feet of the bed.\n\nThe commentary states: \"Stripping the bed by the feet\" means the destruction starts from the lowest part. This highlights how the foundational damage leads to danger and might progressively affect the upper parts.\n\nFor those who receive this hexagram, it suggests the importance of firm determination and focusing on the foundation.

","philosophy":"The second line of the Hexagram Po reads: Six in the second place: Stripping the bed by removing the supports, there is no constancy, misfortune.\n\nExplanation of the Line:\nThe term 'supports' implies separating the upper part from the lower part, referring to the portion between the bed legs and the bed frame. The meaning of this line is: after stripping away the bed legs, the process continues to strip the headboard, eventually resulting in the entire headboard being stripped away, leading inevitably to misfortune.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the stripping action of the second line is more severe than the first line, having moved from the bed legs up to the headboard. The second line lacks resonance with the fifth line and is surrounded by yin lines both above and below.\n\nThe Commentary states: \"Stripping the bed by removing the supports,\" this means there is no help available. This suggests that \"after stripping away the bed legs, the headboard starts to be stripped\" due to the six in the second place's lack of corresponding yang assistance. The absence of external aid leads to a situation of misfortune.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it is crucial to adhere to the path of righteousness and not to harm others. If you seize the opportunity to harm others, although you may retaliate against them, you will also suffer damage.

Life lessons:\nThe Image says: \"Stripping without blame,\" one loses both above and below.\nIn the hexagram where things are stripped away, the two lines below are in a dangerous position. Why can the six in the third position achieve \"without blame\"? It is because it separates itself from the sequence of Yin lines above and below, possessing a latent Yang nature. The Yin line occupies a Yang position, indicating it is not part of the force of stripping. It does not wish to follow the corrupt path but instead aligns with the Yang line at the top. To escape this state of being stripped away, one must abandon the darkness for the light, naturally avoiding disaster.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, there might be situations of luxury and corruption around you; you should maintain your integrity and not follow the corrupt path, thus avoiding disaster.\n\nThe six in the third position is akin to those in society who seek pleasure, yet without calamity. Why? Because the six in the third does not associate with the crowd of Yin lines. In a prosperous era, if everyone practised frugality, it would not be called a flourishing age. The pursuit of pleasure is an inevitable outcome of prosperity. The six in the third also seeks pleasure but does not form cliques or harm the interests of the government, so there is no disaster. For example, there was an official in the Qing dynasty who also indulged in good food and drink daily, had numerous wives and concubines, and delighted in sheer enjoyment. Yet he fulfilled his duties, did not oppress the people, and did not embezzle from the state treasury. How could he then encounter disaster? In dramas, everyone regards Ji Xiaolan as an upright official, yet Ji Xiaolan also pursued personal enjoyment. Historical records state that he had an exceptionally strong libido, so one wife was not enough to satisfy him, resulting in many wives and concubines. However, he did not forcibly seize the daughters of civilians or steal from the state treasury, nor did he harm national interests. He also bravely opposed the grand corruption of He Shen, thus earning the respect of both the people and the emperor, ensuring he did not face disaster."},"line_4":{"description":"Stripping the bed to the skin, misfortune.\n\nThe Image says: Stripping the bed to the skin indicates that the disaster is very near.","interpretation":"Line four: Removing the mat from the bed, this is an omen of danger.  \nThe commentary says: Removing the mat from the bed, disaster is imminent.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: For those who receive this line, their luck is unfavorable, and in times of danger, there are many disputes, litigation, and conflicts.

The meaning of this line is that the bed's surface begins to peel away, inevitably leading to danger.\n\nLife Lesson from Six in the Fourth Position: \"The surface of the bed is stripped away,\" indicating that disaster is near. The stripping starts from the foot of the bed, then to the legs, the head, and now the surface begins to peel away, suggesting that disaster is approaching. As the surface of the bed is damaged, it will endanger those on the bed, signifying the proximity of disaster.\n\nThis fourth line belongs to a yin line in a soft position, representing a petty person in their proper place, who is close to the sovereign at position six in the fifth place, intending to destroy the righteous path. Just as in history, individuals like Li Linfu and other petty officials held power, leading to the loss of justice. Although the Six in the Fourth Position gains power, it is in opposition to the yang line of the Ninth in the Upper Position. When yin wanes and yang waxes, there is a potential for conflict with the yang line representing justice, presenting a dire threat.\n\nThose who draw this line should be aware that the old foundation has already crumbled and deteriorated. You may face imminent changes and have the opportunity to establish a new foundation.\n\nThe holder of Six in the Fourth Position wields significant power and is insatiable, oppressing the common people and harming the interests of the country.

Why then does the fifth line result in a \"nothing unfavorable\" outcome? This conveys the benefits of good management. In this line, the inferior individuals are like palace maidens, obediently serving the sovereign, content in their roles and duties, thus turning danger into safety.\n\nFor those who receive this line in a divination, it is crucial to wisely employ competent individuals. Pay attention to effective division of labor, allowing each to utilize their skills and take responsibility.

In confronting the situation of \"stripping,\" Top Nine, as the sole yang line, experiences hardships but ultimately succeeds, gaining the support of the people. Meanwhile, the petty person is defeated.\n\nThe \"Image\" says, \"The noble receives a carriage,\" carried by the people; \"the petty person’s dwelling is stripped,\" and can never be used.

The Li hexagram features yang lines on the top and bottom and a yin line in the middle, resembling flickering flames, symbolizing fire.\n\nThe Li hexagram contains a yin line in the middle and two yang lines on the outside, signifying an exterior that is firm and an interior that is soft, with a tendency to develop from the center outward, symbolizing dispersion. All creatures like turtles, crabs, armoured animals, and objects such as soldiers' attire, which have a firm exterior and soft interior, are categorized under the Li hexagram.\n\nThe symbolic meanings of the Li hexagram include brightness, advancement, attachment, splendor, brilliance, civilization, decorum, discernment, openness, discovery, expansion, proliferation, outward strength, internal dryness, impatience, agitation, rejection, resistance, denial, critique, popularity, exposure, investigation, frivolousness, display, complacency, eloquence, defiance, lying, desiccation, dullness, and emptiness.\n\nAmong the sixty-four hexagrams, the Li hexagram repeats itself from the Bagua, symbolized by Li signifies attachment. The Sequence of the Hexagrams states: \"A trap must have something to attach to, hence follows with Li; Li means attachment.\" The upper trigram of Li is Kan, indicating that being trapped in a pit will necessarily attach to some place, thus Li follows Kan.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image explains Li as \"bright works twice, Li; the great man continues the brightness to illuminate the four quarters.\" Here, the Li hexagram is likened to the sun. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, embodying the image of being surrounded by light. To continually shine with brilliance, the sun must hang high and attach to the sky, representing attachment. Great individuals should emulate this by continually extending their bright virtues like sunlight to all directions.\n\nThe insight of the Li hexagram is about attachment and reliance, ranking in the upper middle. The Commentary on the Image interprets it: if officials cast divination regarding prospects, it predicts promotion; for farmers, an increase in wealth; for traders, abundant profits; and for craftsmen, great prosperity."},"line_1":{"description":"At the beginning of nine: Tread with caution and revere; there will be no mistake.\n\nThe image says: Reverence in treading carefully is to ward off blame.","interpretation":"At the initial stage, hearing the sound of rushing footsteps, be immediately alert and vigilant, and there will be no disaster.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image says: Hearing the sound of rushing footsteps, being immediately alert and vigilant, one can avoid disaster.","scholar_interpretation":"When obtaining this line, one must guard against unexpected calamities and should be cautious, as there may be afflictions of the feet.

Confusion: Indicates a state of disorder. \n\nThe meaning of this yao text is: The steps are chaotic, but by maintaining respect and caution, there is no fault. \n\nFrom the hexagram's image, the initial nine is a yang line occupying a firm position, characterized by strength, vigorous movement, and an active, proactive nature. Located at the beginning (initial nine) signifies the start of an endeavor, with traits of eagerness for quick success. If, at the commencement of an endeavor, the direction is unsettled and one is hastily striving for advancement, it may lead to reckless actions, stumbling in confusion, with the potential of falling into danger. This line warns against this, advising caution and avoiding rash actions.\n\nThe commentary states: \"Respect amidst confusion in walking\" is to avoid blame. It advises that at the onset of action, due to the eagerness to succeed, disorder may arise. However, upon noticing this, one must become respectful and cautious and avoid rashness; this is primarily to prevent calamity.\n\nThose who obtain this hexagram, if lacking a clear goal and facing confusion in their steps, might be led in the wrong direction. Therefore, through self-reflection and establishing a clear goal and direction, then proceeding with a respectful and cautious attitude, one can avoid mistakes.\n\nThe initial nine suggests that one should first clearly understand the object of their reliance. Whether the reliance is on a company, boss, friend, goal, or ideal, one should not be hasty or aggressive. Instead, be cautious and respectful, understand clearly, and then take action.\n\nFor those who obtain this line, there may be mistakes in etiquette in dealing with people or issues, even leading to embarrassing situations. At this time, one can sincerely apologize to the other party and offer a small gift, and the other party will not hold a grudge. If participating in a ceremony, actions should be cautious and solemn to avoid errors."},"line_2":{"description":"Six in the second place: Yellow brightness.

","philosophy":"The second line of the Li hexagram, line text: \"Six in the second place: Yellow Li, great fortune.\" Explanation of the line text: The meaning of this line text is: to adhere to the yellow. This line emphasizes adhering to the principle of moderation and righteousness. The commentary on this line states: \"Yellow Li, great fortune,\" because it achieves the middle path. It points out that \"adhering to yellow brings great fortune\" because yellow represents the center. By upholding the righteous way, one can achieve great fortune.\n\nIn ancient Chinese philosophy, the Five Elements are associated with directions and colors: Wood is in the east and green; Fire is in the south and red; Metal is in the west and white; Water is in the north and black; Earth is in the center and yellow. Yellow being central corresponds to the middle position of the second line of the inner trigram, and thus it adheres to the central color. Also, the second line is a yin line in a yin position, which is appropriate, matching the characteristics of a yin line and possessing the virtue of moderation. Therefore, the result is great fortune.\n\nThose who obtain this line are advised to follow the path of moderation when interacting with others, avoiding extremes. By doing so, one will be welcomed by people from all walks of life and will find success in their endeavors."},"line_3":{"description":"Nine in the third place: Sunset brings departure.

Beating the earthenware pot means drumming on a clay container. \"Very old\" refers to an elderly person around eighty years old. \"Lamentations\" refer to sighs of lament.\n\nThis line signifies: As the sun sets in the west, if one cannot beat the earthenware pot and sing loudly at this moment, then one will emit the sighs of an aging person, leading to misfortune.\n\nFor one who obtains this line, they should maintain a cautious attitude in their actions and be aware of potential dangers while being in a state of peace. They should also understand that life and death are natural principles and have an unspoken understanding of fate.\n\nAs the sun reaches its zenith and begins its descent towards the west, when a career is at its peak, it will naturally start to decline. One must have a sufficient understanding of this and a broad-minded attitude to accept it all, just as one must accept that people progress from youth to old age. Even when entering the twilight years, one should beat the wine jar and sing, enjoy the remaining years, and accept one's fate contentedly; otherwise, you will inevitably lament endlessly and be needlessly sorrowful.\n\nFor someone who obtains this line, it also indicates that the object one wishes to rely on will not last long: maybe you’ve joined a company on a downward slope, or you’re depending on an elder.\n\nThe analysis of this line in the ‘Image’ suggests: “The brightness of the setting sun,” how can it last long! It points out that as the sun leans towards the west, it is about to set, people enter old age and are close to dying, how can it last long!\n\nOne who obtains this line, when looking for a job or an object of reliance, must investigate the other party's situation before taking action."},"line_4":{"description":"Suddenly it comes, as if with fire, it dies, as if discarded.  \nThe Image says: Suddenly it comes, as if there is no place to contain it.","interpretation":"Nine in the fourth position: Disaster suddenly strikes, the enemy burns houses on sight and kills people on sight, turning this place into a wasteland.  \nThe Image says: Disaster arrives so abruptly that people have no place to hide and escape for their lives.","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: For those who receive this line, the timing is unfavorable and beset with difficulties, potentially leading to discord with elders or entanglement in official troubles.\n\nInterpretation by renowned scholar Fu Peirong from Taiwan:\n\nFortune: To avoid disaster, it may be better to retreat.\n\nWealth: Loss of both wealth and people, caution is advised to avoid this.\n\nHome: The crime of an unfilial child; marriage is inauspicious.\n\nHealth: Life is in a critical situation.","philosophy":"Suddenly it comes, like burning, like death, like being abandoned.\n\nThe word \"like\" here is equivalent to \"thus,\" a structural particle meaning a certain appearance or state. \"Burning\" refers to the act of combustion. \"Abandon\" means to discard.\n\nThe line's meaning is: It comes suddenly, like flames blazing, posing a life-threatening situation, leading to abandonment.\n\nThe fourth nine tells people that when seeking attachment or support, one should not take advantage of others' vulnerabilities or employ coercion.\n\nFrom the hexagram imagery, the fourth nine is a yang line in a yin position, symbolizing rash and impetuous behavior. This line is close to the ruler's position of the fifth six, resembling a minister close to the ruler. However, this minister does not show allegiance to the sovereign of the fifth six and may even oppress the gentle ruler. This situation resembles a scenario where the original monarch suddenly departs, and the determined heir should ascend the throne. Yet, the minister tries to usurp power and seize the position.\n\nThe Commentary on the Image analyzes this line as follows: \"Suddenly it comes,\" meaning there is no room for it.\n\nIt points out that \"coming suddenly, like flames blazing\" refers to a fierce and volatile temperament that inevitably brings danger, which is intolerable to the people of the world.\n\nThe line text's \"like burning, like death, like being abandoned\" all describe the state of the fourth six. \"Like burning\" refers to its intense and irritable nature as if being consumed by fire; \"like death\" indicates a great calamity that leads to demise; \"like being abandoned\" signifies its reputation being ruined, resulting in public disdain.\n\nThe outcome for this fourth six line is quite unfortunate, due to not adhering to the rightful path. Those who draw this line should take care not to exploit others' vulnerabilities for personal gain or employ coercive means to secure positions or promotions. It is crucial to maintain the rightful path to achieve favorable outcomes."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the Fifth Place: Tears flow like torrents, cries of lamentation, auspicious.\n\nThe Image says: The auspiciousness of the nine in the fifth place is due to clinging to the king and lords.\n\nThe propitiousness discussed here stems from the fact that the line symbol indicates that the nine in the fifth place is under the nine in the top position, resembling people being able to rely on the king and lords and find salvation.","interpretation":"After the calamity has passed, people weep, people lament, yet it is auspicious.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says:","scholar_interpretation":"Those who obtain this line should not advance, but rather maintain the status quo.

It is pressured by two yang lines above and below it. Below, it faces disapproval from nearby high officials, and above, retired officials or virtuous individuals out of office. Hence, it finds itself in a state of worry and fear, leading to tears and sighs. Fortunately, the sixth line is in the monarch's position. Although the situation is dangerous, constant vigilance born out of worry allows turning adversity into something favorable, thus bringing auspiciousness.\n\nFor someone who obtains this line, they may have just escaped a perilous situation. While they weep with relief, they should immediately seek the protection of powerful and influential figures. Alternatively, they might have encountered disaster, going through a stage of tears flowing like springs and sighs of sorrow, with relatives and friends experiencing grief along with them.

Yao Ci explanation: \"Jia\" refers to commendation. \"Zhe Shou\" means to decapitate the enemy leader. \"Fei\" means opposing or rejecting. \"Chou\" refers to the jester, or accomplice. The meaning of this line is: The king uses a virtuous person to lead an expedition, granting commendation to those who can behead the enemy leader, but avoids capturing ordinary followers, thus there is no disaster.\n\nFrom the hexagram image, the upper nine is already the highest point of this hexagram. The Li Hexagram represents brightness, and the upper nine line can be viewed as the peak of brightness. It is at a high position, capable of seeing every corner of the country clearly. Furthermore, the upper nine is a yang line, representing strength and decisiveness, capable of using force to punish the wicked. However, in the process of expedition, it is necessary to adhere to righteousness, not indiscriminately killing the innocent, only executing the leaders and sparing the followers, thus there is no blame. This line indicates that evil should be eliminated but only the main culprits should be executed, not the accomplices.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" analysis of this line states: \"When the king goes on an expedition,\" it is to set the state in order.

The Qian trigram symbolizes the vastness of the sky, while the Kan trigram symbolizes dense clouds. In the context of traditional agrarian society, rain is the greatest necessity, hence it is represented by this imagery. The ancients extended the meaning to signify that when rain is about to fall, all things wait in anticipation, thus calling it Xu, meaning ‘Waiting.’\n\nThe ancient character structure for Xu is comprised of the elements 'rain' above, 'heaven' below, with the sound derived from rain. It signifies rain falling from the sky, nourishing all things and people. From the human perspective, when it rains, it becomes difficult to travel or farm, so one stays indoors to drink wine, eat meat, and patiently wait for the right moment. Therefore, the fundamental symbol of this hexagram is waiting, refraining from action, and implies eating and drinking.\n\nThe Hexagram Xu follows the Hexagram Meng, and in the \"Sequence of Hexagrams,\" it is explained thus: \"The immature cannot be without nourishment, thus it is followed by Xu. Xu pertains to the way of food and drink.\" What is needed is also what is awaited.\n\nThe \"Image\" says: Clouds rise to the sky, Xu; the noble one uses this time to feast and enjoy themselves.\n\nThis passage from the \"Image\" means: The image of the Xu hexagram is Qian (heaven) below Kan (water) above, representing water in the sky. Water vapor accumulates in the sky to form clouds, dense clouds fill the sky, yet it hasn't rained, thus one must wait. At this time, the noble one must eat and drink, make merry, that is, accumulate strength while waiting.\n\nXu symbolizes waiting and inspires people to uphold righteousness and seize opportunities at the right moment, belonging to the middle-upper hexagrams.

The Initial Nine in this line separates from the Kan hexagram, akin to being at the outskirts away from the city center.\n\nFrom the hexagram image perspective, Initial Nine, as a yang line occupying a firm position, is appropriately placed. Its distance from the upper Kan hexagram also implies distance from danger, hence it is described as \"waiting at the outskirts.\" However, yang lines are active and prone to rash movements; being in opposition to Nine Two, it will inevitably encounter obstruction from Nine Two, potentially inviting disaster.

However, Nine in the second place, Nine in the third place, and Six in the fourth place form the Dui hexagram, Dui represents joy and brightness, symbolizing that Nine in the second place will eventually experience days of joy and brightness.

By maintaining a pure heart while participating, they can achieve their objectives through the gathering, leading to a prosperous outcome.\n\nOccupying the position of a ruler, the Nine in the Fifth Place naturally enjoys the pleasures of food and drink. However, it must be guided by righteousness to remain fortunate. In ancient times, many emperors descended into decadence and corruption due to these indulgences. For instance, a king who initially ruled wisely eventually created ivory chopsticks, which led from simple luxury to extreme extravagance, bringing about the downfall of the nation. Therefore, the pleasure of food and drink must be founded on righteous principles to be truly auspicious."},"line_6":{"description":"Top six: Entering into the cave, there come three unexpected guests.

Hence, the Top Six embodies the image of “entering the cave.” \n\nThe “three unexpected guests” refer to the three yang lines in the lower hexagram.

Kan, representing water, is below, and Dui, representing marsh, is above. When the marsh water flows into the Kan water, the marsh water diminishes; when the Kan water flows into the Eastern Sea, the Kan water also diminishes. As the water decreases, it will inevitably face distress. From another perspective, when the two waters combine and the water increases, it can result in disaster, leading to hardship for the people of the world.\n\nRegarding the imagery of the hexagram, Kan represents danger below, and Dui represents joy above. This suggests that one encounters danger first and then faces distress, subsequently overcoming difficulties and achieving joy. It implies that, even when trapped in a predicament where one's talents are hard to exhibit, by steadfastly adhering to the right path and finding joy within oneself, success can be achieved, and the predicament can be overcome.\n\nThe Hexagram Kun follows the Hexagram Sheng, as explained in the Sequence of Hexagrams: \"After ascending constantly, one must inevitably encounter hardship, thus followed by distress.\" Continuous ascent ultimately leads to encountering difficulties, which provides an opportunity to test one's character and presents a turning point toward communication and understanding.\n\nIn the Commentary on the Symbol, this is how the Kun Hexagram is explained: \"A marsh without water signifies distress; a noble person dedicates themselves to fulfilling their aspirations.\" This points out that the hexagram’s image is Kan (water) below and Dui (marsh) above, representing a marsh without water, symbolizing distress. A noble person should maintain their determination despite adversity, willing to sacrifice their life to achieve their ambitions.\n\nThe Hexagram Kun symbolizes adversity, admonishing people on the principles of seeking clarity in difficult situations. It is considered an intermediate to upper-level hexagram.

From the hexagram symbolism, the initial six is in the lower trigram of Kan, the beginning, Kan symbolizes a ravine, representing the buttocks. Above Kan joins with Xun, Xun symbolizes wood, hence \"buttocks trapped in a tree stump.\" Xun also means \"enter,\" with interspersed Li below, Li has the symbolism of emptiness and secluded valleys. In the \"Image,\" this line is analyzed as: \"Entering a secluded valley,\" indicating obscurity and darkness.

The 'Image' explains this line: \"Relying on thorns,\" signifies riding over hardness; \"Entering the chamber, not seeing his wife,\" is a bad omen. This signifies: \"Caught amidst chaotic rocks, surrounded by a thicket of thorns,\" indicating yin surpassing yang, akin to standing on piercing thorns, extremely distressed. \"Returning home and not seeing his wife,\" implies misfortunes do not come singly; beset by troubles, the home additionally suffers misfortune, indeed a sign of great ill fortune.\n\nIn the 'Commentary on the Decision,' it explains: \"Being confined where one ought not to be confined brings disgrace.

Although some difficulties will be encountered, there will ultimately be a good outcome. From the perspective of the hexagram, the fourth line has already entered the upper trigram, not being obstructed but overcoming obstruction. However, the fourth line, being a yang line in a yin position, is out of place, and it is in opposition to the fifth yang line in the hexagram, being covered by the upper sixth line, thus unable to advance. It can only assist the first line that resonates with it to overcome difficulties. The lower trigram of the Kun Hexagram is Kan, indicating that initially, the fourth line does not proceed smoothly, encountering the difficulty of pits and traps. Fortunately, with the support of the second line, it finally emerges from the predicament. \n\nIn the \"Image,\" it explains this line: \"Coming slowly\" means the resolve is below; although not in a proper position, there is support. This points out that \"coming slowly\" signifies a lack of grand ambition, focusing instead on humbling oneself to assist others to escape the predicament; although the position is unsuitable and the role cannot be fulfilled, support from like-minded individuals can be obtained.

Cutting refers to removing parts below the ankle. Ceremonial robes refer to the official garb of ministers. \"Say\" is synonymous with \"relief.\"\n\nThe lesson of this line is to maintain integrity and sincerity in order to overcome difficulties. The Nine in the Fifth Position occupies the sovereign's role in the entire hexagram. The ruler's difficulty lies in the obstruction of communication, the disconnect between upper and lower levels; if tyrannical policies are implemented, it will result in widespread dissent and alienation.\n\nThe \"Image\" interprets this line as follows: \"Mutilated at the nose and toes\" symbolizes unfulfilled aspirations. \"Eventually, he finds relief\" signifies adherence to moderation and honesty. \"Beneficial to make offerings\" denotes the receipt of blessings. This suggests that governing with extreme cruelty will leave the highest leader isolated and universally opposed. \"Gently emerges from difficulty,\" is entirely due to upholding moderation and maintaining moral integrity. \"Emerging from difficulty is due to sincerely making offerings to the divine\" means that with sincere respect for the divine, one can receive blessings and attain good fortune.\n\nFor those who draw this line, it may indicate a leader of a unit whose arrogance clouded judgment, mistaking loyal advice for malicious words, causing confusion and dissatisfaction among others.

Proceeding in this way leads to regret.\" \n\nExplanation of the line:\n\"Penalties to people\" refers to the ancient script for \"model,\" which was used to make pottery molds or sand molds for casting. Here, \"penalty\" can be understood as a rule or enforced correction and is a form of education. \"Shackles and fetters\" refers to wooden restraints. \"Remove\" is similar in meaning to \"escape.\"\n\nThe meaning of this line is to say: Enlightening ignorance, it is suitable to educate people about the rules and penalties to standardize their behavior. This is to educate people not to engage in unlawful or criminal acts, allowing them to escape the suffering of the fetters. If someone does not focus on learning these before taking action, they will encounter difficulties in the future.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the Initial Six line is a yin line occupying a strong position, misplaced and not centered, representing a lack of moderation. It behaves like a child who is reckless and impulsive. The Initial Six follows the Nine Two, which acts like a mentor, strictly supervising and appropriately disciplining it, guiding it onto the right path. When it grows up, it will adhere to laws and regulations, avoiding imprisonment. Otherwise, if left unchecked, it will make grave errors in the future and deeply regret them.\n\nThe teaching of the Initial Six line is a method of educating people, which can be seen as the role of an example. However, it adopts the opposing aspect of an example: the role of a negative model. It serves as a warning to people. For example, to educate people not to break the law, they are taught about the legal regulations and shown the consequences of criminals, telling them, \"If you break the law, you will end up like them, wearing handcuffs and shackles.\" Through this method, people are advised to adhere to laws and regulations."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: Enveloping ignorance brings good fortune.

When she sees a wealthy man, she will lose herself.

She loses herself upon encountering a wealthy man. Marrying her brings no advantage. From the perspective of the hexagram's imagery, Six-Three is a yin line in a yang position, indicating a lack of position and inability to remain centered. The verdict of this hexagram is \"no benefits,\" meaning that there are no advantages. Marrying a materialistic woman who loses her integrity upon meeting a wealthy man is harmful rather than beneficial to a marriage. A wife has a significant influence on children; an unvirtuous wife can bring chaos to the family, negatively affecting the children's upbringing, which is why it is deemed \"no benefits.\"\n\nThe Image says: \"Do not marry such a woman\" signifies that her conduct is disorderly. This means she does not adhere to propriety, lacking proper enlightenment or upbringing.

The yang line represents the enlightener, while the yin line stands for those who are ignorant. In examining the fourth line, although it is a yin line in a yielding position, which is suitable, it is surrounded by yin lines above and below. It is distanced from both the two yang lines: the second and the top lines. Hence, it is trapped in ignorance, with no one to turn to for help and unable to take action, thus falling into difficulties. The fourth line is encircled by yin lines, which repel each other, and being at the lower part of the Gen Hexagram, seems as if it is pressed down by a mountain. Naturally, it cannot escape a fate of entrapment. In the Meng Hexagram, the yin line represents ignorance. The fourth line is trapped by what is likewise, unable to resonate with the yang lines.

In other words, when it comes to the education of children, enlightenment education should be implemented early, targeting the shortcomings of the youth, preemptively. A child is like a blank sheet of paper; if you don't give it the right colors, it is easily tainted by other hues.

In the Sequence of Hexagrams, it's explained as: \"Those who are united with people, all things naturally return to them, and thus it is followed by Great Possessing.\" Finding like-minded individuals, everyone works together with one heart, and naturally, resources become abundant, hence Great Possessing follows. \n\nThe Image says: Fire is in Heaven, \"Great Possessing\"; the superior person restrains evil and promotes good, following the Mandate of Heaven.

When fire reaches heaven, it forms the image of the Great Possessing hexagram. As the saying goes, \"many hands make light work,\" when everyone gathers around a fire, it forms the Fellowship with Men hexagram. However, when everyone adds a stick to the fire, it can burn up to the sky, showing that only united can people have greater strength and greater harvests.

Moreover, in the hexagram, other lines are more powerful than \"Initial Nine,\" which cannot confront or match them.

Minimal losses leading to gain is ideal.\n\nThe Great Image: The mountain is high and the water deep, each occupying its proper place, symbolizing gain through loss.\n\nFortune: Currently, everything is unfavorable, with signs of financial loss. Although there may be initial losses, eventually, benefits will arise, turning misfortune into blessing.\n\nCareer: To expand a career, investment is required, and the amount of investment should be meticulously calculated to ensure a balance of loss and gain. All matters should be approached with restraint, avoiding deceit and greed. Self-discipline is the most challenging task; therefore, strict self-requirements and diligent effort are essential. Employing flexible methods will help strive for success in one's career.\n\nCommerce: Conduct a comprehensive investigation of the market conditions and calculate the ratio of investment to return. It is unnecessary to be overly concerned with the amount of profit; it is sufficient to gain. Sincerely cooperate with others, trust each other, remain adaptable, and avoid isolation.\n\nPursuit of Reputation: To grow and progress, investment is necessary, which should be put into practice. Achieve ideals by gaining through loss.\n\nMarriage and Romance: Consider both the strengths and weaknesses of the other party comprehensively, and focus on the bigger picture.\n\nDecision-making: A person with intelligence excels at weighing advantages and disadvantages. Comply with the natural laws of development, actively and proactively cooperate with others, take pleasure in helping others, invest appropriately, and support others. Be frugal rather than extravagant. In this way, everything can proceed very smoothly.","philosophy":"The Hexagram of Diminishment, The Symbolic Meaning of the Mountain Marsh Decrease Hexagram\n\nThe Hexagram of Diminishment, is composed of different trigrams stacked together. The upper trigram is Gen, and the lower trigram is Dui, with Gen representing the mountain and Dui representing the marsh. With Dui below and Gen above, it indicates a marsh beneath the mountain. The water from the marsh seeps upwards, nourishing everything on the mountain, yet it causes the water in the marsh to decrease. Therefore, the hexagram, Dui below and Gen above, is named \"Diminishment,\" indicating the notion of reduction.\n\nFrom another perspective, with Gen above and Dui below, the mountain above and marsh below, it implies that a great marsh erodes the mountain's foundation. Reducing below to benefit above, in governance, excessive reduction can damage the nation's foundation. Appropriate reduction is necessary, but must be done with moderation and restraint. Minimizing reduction for maximal benefit is optimal. The Hexagram of Diminishment symbolizes the alternation between loss and gain, where within loss, there is gain and within gain, there is loss. Between these two, careful consideration is necessary.\n\nThe Hexagram of Diminishment follows the Hexagram of Relief. The \"Sequence of Hexagrams\" explains: \"Relief inevitably leads to loss, thus followed by Diminishment.\" After alleviating difficulties through the Hexagram of Relief, relaxation inevitably leads to loss, thus the appearance of the Hexagram of Diminishment.\n\nIn the \"Image,\" the explanation for this hexagram is: there is a marsh below the mountain, Diminishment; the noble person uses this to curb anger and restrain desires. Here, it points out: the hexagram's image is Dui (marsh) below and Gen (mountain) above, representing the scenario of a marsh beneath the mountain lake, where the lake drains itself to nourish the mountain's life, embodying the meaning of the Hexagram of Diminishment. Adhering to the philosophy contained within this phenomenon, a noble person should suppress anger and violent temperament, eliminate selfish desires, and engage in actions beneficial to the public.\n\nThe Hexagram of Diminishment symbolizes reduction and is considered a lower hexagram. The \"Image\" interprets this hexagram as: movement without overexertion, comparing it to the struggle of pushing a cart on a rugged mountain path, hanging ears down to the right, trying to apply pressure but unable to touch."},"line_1":{"description":"At the beginning of Nine: After the matter is completed, proceed promptly, there is no blame, ponder the decrease of it.\n\nThe Image says: After the matter is completed, proceeding promptly aligns harmoniously with the aspiration.","interpretation":"Initial Nine: In significant sacrificial rituals, one must promptly participate.

It's appropriate to moderately reduce some benefits for yourself.\n\nFrom the hexagram image, the First Nine is at the beginning of the Hexagram of Decrease, indicating the need to decrease below while benefiting above. This must be done appropriately, without excess or overindulgence.\n\nIn the \"Image\" it is explained: \"Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed,\" which means aligning with the intention. It is pointed out here: \"Stop what you are doing and quickly go to help others.\" Those in honored positions, who are weak, need assistance. Therefore, those in humble positions, full of vigor, should take the lead, not shirk responsibility, and immediately sacrifice their own pursuits to help others achieve greatness. This demonstrates a relationship of mutual harmony with those in high places.\n\nFor those receiving this line in divination, if someone around you encounters difficulties, you should promptly offer assistance. Although there may be some loss, it can build connections and leave a good impression on others. However, do not provide all your help; only offer appropriate assistance.\n\nFirst Nine: Halt your current tasks and swiftly proceed; there will be no misfortune. Consider reducing.\n\nThe Image says: Once tasks are completed, swiftly proceed; it aligns with one's aspirations.\n\nThe text means: Having completed tasks, one goes quickly, without disaster, only losing a little, like not drinking much. The Image means: Upon completing tasks, going quickly aligns with one’s intentions.\n\nThe First Nine and Six Four correspond, like Six Four hosting a banquet and inviting the First Nine. The First Nine, due to being preoccupied, finishes the work at hand and then goes to the banquet, only to arrive somewhat late after others have eaten and drunk, leaving just remains. This type of loss is merely missing out on some drinks, thus not leading to disaster. The intent of the First Nine attending the banquet was not for eating or drinking, but to engage with Six Four."},"line_2":{"description":"Nine in the second place: Beneficial to be steadfast; going forward is ominous. Not diminishing, but enhancing it.\n\nThe Commentary says: The benefit of being steadfast in the second line stands for being aligned with one's inner aspirations.\n\nIt speaks of an auspicious divination, because the line nine in the second position occupies the central place in the lower trigram, symbolizing the conduct of a person who acts with integrity and maintains steadfastness as their principle.","interpretation":"Nine in the second place: Auspicious is the divination.

The meaning of this line statement is: It is beneficial to uphold the righteous path, taking the initiative to attack will bring misfortune; benefits can be provided to the noble without any loss.\n\nFrom the hexagram image, the nine at the second place is in the lower trigram Dui, being a yang line in a yin position, which means it is out of place. The nine at the second place, due to its yang nature, has characteristics of being active and rash. If it sets out on an expedition, it might encounter misfortune; therefore, it should keep to the center and not go on an expedition.\n\nIn the form of the Image, this line is explained as: Nine at the second place benefits from steadfastness, because its resolve is to maintain the middle path. It points out that this line benefits from upholding the righteous path because it is at a suitable intermediary position. Its own position is not very stable, so it is not suitable for active actions. Only by maintaining a stance that is neither extreme nor overly conservative can it benefit others as an unchanging aspiration.\n\nThose who receive this line are advised to measure their abilities when helping others, as they might not only fail to help but may cause trouble for others if they are rash and adventurous. Additionally, when wanting to help others, consider whether they are worthy of sympathy and assistance. If truly wanting to help others, it is possible to do so without any loss.\n\nNine at the second place: Beneficial for steadfastness, expedition leads to misfortune, do not harm, enhance it.\n\nThe nine at the second place is within the lower hexagram; however, it is a yang line in an even position, meaning it is not in the appropriate position. It is also the lowest line of the lower reciprocal hexagram Zhen, so it appears uneasy with the status quo. It is dissatisfied with the six at the third place above it, since that position originally belonged to the upper nine (from the transformation of Tai to Sun). Therefore, it wishes to displace the six at the third place. Such intentions and actions are dangerous, hence the line statement says, \"expedition leads to misfortune.\" This nine at the second place is akin to a department manager in a unit. Originally, his direct superior was a talented person, but he was transferred, and a mediocre person was appointed as the new superior. So the department manager feels uneasy and wants to displace this new leader. Such behavior would certainly face opposition from the general manager and fail. Therefore, if this department manager wishes to avoid negative consequences, his only option is to adhere to the middle way, do his job well, and not act against the wishes of the higher organization."},"line_3":{"description":"When three people travel together, one will be lost; when one person travels alone, they will find a companion.  \nThe Image says: When one travels alone, with three there is doubt.","interpretation":"Line three: When three people walk together, differing opinions are inevitable, and one person will surely end up isolated.

When one acts alone, he can meet like-minded friends. The Image Commentary analyzes this line as follows: When one walks alone, with three there is doubt. It points out that when three people proceed together, one of them may suffer harm; acting alone can lead to finding companions with shared interests. This indicates that collective efforts should not be rushed without considering the situation; effectiveness and practicality must be prioritized.\n\nFor those divining this line, it suggests not engaging too many partners when undertaking tasks; otherwise, conflicts and differences may arise, causing discord. If acting alone, one can proceed while seeking like-minded companions, thus gaining their support.\n\nFor individuals drawing this line, it is advised to concentrate on their tasks without having too many thoughts or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously. Managing too much can lead to failure, incurring losses. Focus and having one's own opinion are crucial, rather than blindly following others.\n\nThe Image Meaning explains that walking alone finds friends, since with three people, doubts arise. \"Three people walking\" refers to the lower three yang lines of the Tai Hexagram, and \"losing one\" means the ninth line of Tai leaves its position to join the ninth line of Diminishing. \"One person walking\" refers to the second yang line of Tai moving to the upper line position in Diminishing. \"Finding his companion\" indicates the upper ninth line of Diminishing corresponds with the fifth six line and resonates with the third six line.\n\nFundamentally, this line reflects a human weakness. For example, it's said in the West that one Chinese person can defeat one Japanese person, but ten Chinese might not defeat ten Japanese. Why is this? Because situations occur like \"two people walking, one loses out.\" Among ten Chinese, internal conflict often arises, making it difficult to collectively rival the other group. This illustrates that human weaknesses can diminish the power of collective effort."},"line_4":{"description":"Line Six of the Fourth Hexagram: By reducing one's haste, allowing for rapid joy, there is no fault.  \nThe Image says: To reduce one's haste is also a cause for joy.","interpretation":"Line four: To eliminate illness, quickly seek the aid of shamans and make offerings to the spirits, and the sickness will improve, ensuring there will be no misfortune.  \nThe Image says: \"Seeking the aid of shamans and making offerings to the spirits to eliminate illness\" is indeed a cause for rejoicing.","scholar_interpretation":"Obtaining this line signifies many celebratory events.

No blame.\n\nSwiftly: Quickly, immediately.\n\nThe meaning of this line text is: Try to overcome your own weaknesses, welcome the joy that is about to come, and there will be no calamity.\n\nFrom the perspective of the hexagram image, the fourth line is among the mutual Zhen (second, third, and fourth lines), Zhen is associated with decisive action, which further implies indecisiveness. The line text emphasizes the necessity to immediately correct this fault, for only then will joyful events occur.\n\nThe \"Xiang\" commentary on this line explains: \"Reducing one's ailments\" is also delightful. It points out that one should endeavor to overcome personal weaknesses and be prepared to accept assistance from others. This act of overcoming personal weaknesses is indeed a joyous thing.\n\nFor those who obtain this line in divination, it suggests overcoming one's weaknesses. If you encounter troubles in your endeavors, you should minimize the drawbacks quickly to facilitate a turnaround, thereby gaining benefits. If you meet a friend in need of help, while assisting them, you should also point out their weaknesses, and they will surely appreciate it.\n\nThe fourth line: Reduce one's ailments, swiftly bring joy, no blame.\n\nXiang commentary says: Reducing one's ailments is also delightful.\n\nThe meaning of the text is: Alleviate the pain of illness, quickly improve the condition, with no disaster. The meaning of Xiang commentary is: Alleviating pain from illness is also a delightful matter.\n\nWhat is meant by \"reduce one's ailments\" here? It refers to the \"in-fighting\" ailment. In the Tai hexagram, the upper hexagram consists of three yin lines, and such a configuration is analogous to the situation we discussed, similar to ten Chinese sharing a space. This scenario easily leads to in-fighting, resulting in a loss of collective strength. What can be done? The only solution is to reduce one yin line to the lower hexagram, and similarly to transfer one yang line from the lower hexagram to the upper. This creates the Sun hexagram. With this change, the phenomenon of in-fighting is avoided, thus strengthening the collective force. This is the meaning of loss being the beginning of greater strength."},"line_5":{"description":"Six in the fifth place: Someone benefits from it, a tortoise worth ten sheaves, no one can oppose it.

Explanation of the line statement: \"Peng\" was an ancient monetary unit, with two shells forming one \"peng.\" \"Tortoise\" refers to a divine tortoise. The sentence indicates that the opposing side presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\" as a tribute. Do not decline. The meaning of this line is: Someone presents a divine tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it will bring great fortune.\n\nFrom the hexagram image, the fifth line is a yin line occupying a strong position, with a harmony of firmness and softness. Besides being in a correct response with the second line (a yang line), it also connects with the top ninth line. The analysis in \"Image\" explains this line: The great auspiciousness of the fifth line is blessed by higher realms. It points out that the great fortune of the fifth line is entirely due to heavenly blessing. The fifth line, though gentle and residing in a dignified position, still seeks to reduce itself to benefit others. This not only earns broad support from the public but also gains the favor of the heavens. Drawing this line is extremely auspicious, akin to finding jade amidst stone, resulting in financial gain. Perhaps those you have helped previously will begin to repay you. The wealth brought to you is deserved, so do not refuse it. If ever confused, if someone suggests releasing a valuable tortoise, you might do so for great prosperity.\n\nThe fifth line statement says: Someone brings a tortoise worth ten \"peng\"; do not refuse, and it is greatly auspicious. The symbolic explanation notes that the great fortune of the fifth line comes from the protection of the top ninth line. The fifth has obtained a tortoise worth ten \"peng,\" which symbolizes power. The fifth line is in a dignified position, bestowed by whom? By the top ninth line, who comes from the third line of Tai Hexagram to the top ninth line of Sun Hexagram to assist the fifth line in consolidating power.

There is a purpose in advancing, and one gains loyal followers who do not belong to any single household.\n\nInterpretation of the line text: The meaning of this line is that, without causing any loss, one can enable others to gain benefits without fault. Adhering to the right path results in good fortune. At this time, one should boldly proceed with tasks, which will bring benefits to the world, gaining the people's allegiance.\n\nThe top Nine line is at the pinnacle of the Diminishing Hexagram. In the Commentary on the Image, it is analyzed as: \"Without diminishing, one increases,\" signifying great ambition achieved. It points out that \"without causing any loss, one can enable others to gain benefits\" because, being at the highest position of the Diminishing Hexagram, one receives abundant support, allowing benefits to others without self-diminishment. This represents the highest state of the Diminishing Hexagram, realizing the goal pursued by the Diminishing Hexagram.\n\nThe Diminishing Hexagram discusses the reduction of self. However, this kind of diminishing does not mean harming one's own interests to assist others, nor is it ordinary harm to others for self-benefit; rather, it pertains to how one can gain considerable benefits without suffering any harm oneself, or how, without diminishing oneself, one can benefit others. It explores how, in unavoidable situations, one might appropriately reduce or relinquish some interests to pursue greater benefits. This is the essence of the Diminishing Hexagram.\n\nTop Nine: Without diminishing, one increases; no blame, perseverance leads to good fortune. It is advantageous to have a purpose, gaining followers who are loyal and unattached. The Commentary on the Image states: Without diminishing, one increases, indicating a great aspiration can be realized.\n\nThe text means: Without a reduction but with a gain, there is no disaster. By upholding the right path, there is fortune. Advancing is advantageous, with followers who are selfless and unattached.\n\nThe meaning of the Commentary is: Without reduction but achieving gain, it indicates the aspiration can be greatly realized.\n\nThe third line of the Great Hexagram reaches the position of the top Nine, forming the Diminishing Hexagram. This does not cause the upper part of the Diminishing Hexagram to suffer, but rather strengthens the power of the upper part of the Diminishing Hexagram. Hence, the line text states \"Without diminishing, one increases.\"\n\nThe top Nine is beneficial to the upper part of the hexagram, so how could there be disaster? Therefore, if one upholds the right path, fortune naturally comes. \"Gaining followers who are unattached\" means that the top Nine was originally the third line of the Great Hexagram, where the lower part represents the inner family. Therefore, the third line of the Great Hexagram was initially the head of the lower family. But after ascending to the top line of the Diminishing Hexagram, having gained the three inner lines (i.e., followers), it is no longer the head of the lower family, thus \"gaining followers who are unattached.\""}},"61":{"general":{"description":"Inner Truth.

Colleagues will be in discord, advancing first and then retreating.\n\nFortune: The fortune is inverted, with honor and disgrace following accordingly.\n\nWealth: Success and failure come suddenly; there is a lack of decisiveness.\n\nHome: Guard against the bizarre; repeated efforts will be unfulfilled.\n\nHealth: Sometimes good, sometimes bad; seek divine protection.","philosophy":"The meaning of this line is: encountering a powerful enemy, either you beat the drums to attack, retreat due to exhaustion, cry out of fear, or sing because you have escaped disaster. From the hexagram image, the third line being a yin line in a yang position is misplaced. It is at the juncture of the upper and lower trigrams, corresponding with the topmost ninth line, indicating its heart is moved outward, attached to external things. Originally, it should settle in its position, but it seeks to climb up to the ninth line to find opportunities for promotion or greater development. However, it is met with resistance from various sides, putting itself in a state of unease. The Image explains this line: \"either beat the drums or retreat,\" indicating that its position is not right. It points out: \"encountering a powerful enemy, either beat the drums to attack, or retreat due to exhaustion,\" all because the third line is not in the correct position.\n\nThose who draw this line, regardless of having a background or close relationships with higher-level leaders, try hard to flatter and curry favor to seek promotion or convenience for their own development. However, people around you or superiors are very displeased with such actions, creating obstacles or setbacks for you. Moreover, the person you are relying on is not the highest authority, hence facing many obstructions.\n\nLine Three: Encountering an enemy, either beat the drums or retreat, either cry or sing.\n\nThe Image says: \"Either beat the drums or retreat,\" indicating the position is not right."},"line_4":{"description":"Nine in the fourth place: The moon is almost full. The horse disappears. No blame.  \nThe Image says: The horse disappears. It is disconnected from its kind and goes upward.","interpretation":"Six in the fourth place: In the middle of the month, the horses are lost, but there is no great misfortune.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: The loss of the horses means that one must be doubly vigilant thereafter to prevent similar occurrences.","scholar_interpretation":"Flat: Those who obtain this line can receive promotion, but there is a worry of losing a spouse or property. Officials will be promoted and hold important positions.  \nFortune: Maintain stability and prosperity, prioritize public over private matters.  \nWealth: Undertakings go smoothly, and financial resources are also abundant.  \nHome: An excess of yin energy; possible loss of a spouse.  \nHealth: Can gradually recover.","philosophy":"The hexagram Zhong Fu, Fourth Line, Line Statement: Six Four: The moon is nearly full; the horse loses its mate. No blame.\n\nExplanation of the Line Statement: \"Full\" refers to the image of the moon on the fifteenth or sixteenth day of the lunar month, indicating that the moon is about to be full but not completely full yet. The meaning of this line statement is: The moon is about to be full but not yet completely full, and a good horse has lost its mate, but there is no fault.\n\nFrom the hexagram's image, Six Four is a yin line occupying a yielding position, which is appropriate. It represents the position of a high-ranking minister close to the ruler, who has a good relationship with the Nine Five ruler and has earned their trust. However, Six Four cannot maintain the correct path and has questionable ties with the Initial Nine below, suggesting an inclination towards forming personal factions. But Six Four is aware of this danger and remains loyal only to Nine Five, thus severing ties with Initial Nine. This is like the horse that is loyal only to its master and not to its peers, symbolizing the \"loss of its mate.\" Since Six Four can rectify itself, there is no fault.\n\nIn the image (Xiàng Zhuàn), this line is analyzed as: \"The horse loses its mate,\" indicating that Six Four severs ties with its peers and focuses on serving the ruler.\n\nFor those who receive this line in divination, you may currently face two choices, possibly implying divided loyalties in work or emotions. At this moment, you should make a decisive choice, and naturally, you know which choice is better and more beneficial for you, so you must abandon one to avoid any fault. In a work setting, if you are the assistant to a leader and find yourself agreeing with colleagues who criticize the leader and grow too close to them, you should promptly sever these ties; otherwise, you will invite trouble upon yourself.\n\nSix Four: The moon is nearly full; the horse loses its mate. No blame.\n\nThe Xiàng Commentary states: \"The horse loses its mate,\" severing ties with its kind to align with the noble Nine Five.\n\nThe text's meaning is: The moon is near the fifteenth, the horse loses its mate, bringing no disaster.\n\nThe Xiàng meaning is: The horse loses its mate, showing Six Four cuts ties with its kind and serves the Nine Five."},"line_5":{"description":"Nine in the fifth place: There is sincerity bound like an attachment, no blame.\n\nThe Image says: There is sincerity bound like an attachment, because the position is correct and appropriate.","interpretation":"Nine in the fifth place: Captives are gathered in groups, bound together. There is no disaster.  \nThe commentary states: With a heart of sincerity and consistency from beginning to end, just as the image of the line at the ninth five suggests, one's actions align with their position.","scholar_interpretation":"Favorable: Those who obtain this line experience harmonious human relations, achieve success in their endeavors, and find fortune in all pursuits. Officials who work together with a unified mind will receive commendation from their superiors. \n\nCurrent luck: The luck is balanced, and all requests will be answered. \n\nFinancial fortune: By working with a united effort, there will be successful business operations. \n\nHome and family: A harmonious household; a long and happy union. \n\nHealth: Difficulties with limbs, but illness does not shorten life.","philosophy":"The fifth line of the Zhongfu Hexagram, line text: Nine in the fifth place: There is sincerity, like a bond. No blame. Explanation of the line text: Bonding refers to a close connection that cannot be separated. The meaning of the line text is: possessing the virtue of sincerity, thereby binding the hearts of people throughout the world, closely connecting with the masses, thus avoiding misfortune. \n\nInsight from the fifth line of the Zhongfu Hexagram: From the hexagram image, the fifth element, yang, occupies the position of the ruler, adhering to the middle way and collaborating with the fourth, supporting one another, so there is no mistake. The commentary in \"Xiang\" analyzes this line as follows: \"There is sincerity, like a bond,\" due to the position being appropriate. Here it points out: \"possessing the virtue of sincerity and thereby binding the hearts of people throughout the world\" implies that the position is appropriately centered, indicating that sincerity's educational influence can extend throughout the nation.\n\nFor those who draw this line, it is important to understand that as a leader, if you sincerely treat your subordinates, they will genuinely reciprocate. In relationships, if both parties treat each other with sincerity, their feelings will elevate and develop. \n\nNine in the fifth place: There is sincerity, like a bond. No blame. The image says: There is sincerity, like a bond, because the position is rightly occupied. The scripture's meaning is: linking the world with sincerity, without calamity. The image's meaning is: linking the world with sincerity is because the nine in the fifth place occupies the center appropriately."},"line_6":{"description":"Top ninth line: The cry of the wild goose ascends to the heavens, persistence leads to misfortune.  \nThe commentary says: The cry of the wild goose ascends to the heavens; how can it endure for long?","interpretation":"Top nine: The rooster flies up to the sky. Divination reveals a bad omen.  \nThe Commentary on the Image says: When the rooster flies up to the sky, how can it fly for long?","scholar_interpretation":"Misfortune: Those who obtain this line encounter more emptiness than substance, with a perilous road ahead.

Interpretation of the line commentary:\n\nThe pheasant refers to the red-feathered mountain chicken, also called the golden pheasant. The meaning of this line commentary is that the pheasant, relying on its splendid appearance, loudly calls as if it intends to fly to heaven, which may result in misfortune.\n\nFrom the hexagram's appearance, the top nine sits in a yin position, unable to maintain centrality and righteousness, and is antagonistic to the fifth nine. Although it may have had past achievements or boasts some reputation, it is, like the pheasant, just an outward show. It lacks the ability to ascend to heaven, yet it shrilly announces its intention to do so, akin to a deceptive charlatan flaunting falsehoods, which makes it very perilous.\n\nThe Image analysis in the text explains this line: \"The pheasant's call rises to the heavens,\" how can it last? It points out that \"the pheasant, relying on its splendid appearance, loudly calls as if to ascend to heaven,\" yet this sound is hollow and unrealistic, louder than the actual situation, and how can it maintain the posture for long?\n\nFor those who obtain this line in their divination, refrain from attempting what you cannot achieve, and do not resort to blustering to impress others or gain followers, for eventually you will reveal your shortcomings and encounter disaster. If you were once successful and arrogant because of it, soon you will taste the bitterness of failure.\n\nTop Nine: The pheasant's call rises to the heavens, persistence brings misfortune. \n\nThe Image says: The pheasant's call rises to the heavens, how can it last? \n\nThe text's meaning is: A chicken flying to the sky, maintaining righteousness is perilous. \n\nThe Image's meaning is: A chicken flying to the sky, how can it fly for long?"}}}
