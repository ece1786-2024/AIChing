4	工作去了后能否提升工资？	0	After going to work, is it possible to get a salary raise?	戊子年丁巳月癸亥日	因为测问工作去了后能否提升工资，是为测财运，所以取 3爻妻财卯木为用，用神妻财卯木持世，卯木随虽动本应吉，但可惜卯化出申金劫财回头克世，世矛木财星又逢日冲破，事损克，在月亦处于泻气之地，所以财爻用神不旺，偏弱，持世主有财，能求到财，但是化兄弟克劫主求不了大财，所的之财为比较辛苦所得。其用爻卯木内卦上爻《第三爻》为动爻，主事情发展快，吉凶易见且应验迅速，财动有动之象，不见源财难旺，除非水木来临，而在今年水木之月要等到冬季，夏秋一般，到了今年冬季利财。白虎临财爻用神爻发动，白虎发动主刑伤，官司疾病不利，财虽然临世为喜用，但是可惜又化回头克和日冲劫，所以求工资难涨。其求财的原神子孙爻未上卦，做事少人帮，须靠自己的力量，也表示事物的发展缺乏原动力。忌神兄弟比较旺，劫财强于财星，所以求财辛苦，财不大，但是兄弟不动，亦不至于有什么大破财之忧，但是要注意下农历7月份和农历8月份，今年的农历七，八两个月为庚申，辛酉纯金之运，在这两个月要注意可能有为不必要的事情而花消大，是劫财临旺之月，因为。在农历PN月份和PP月份财运比较不错。求财财神不旺，兄弟劫财也不动，逢月克也不够旺，所以总体来看，不会破财，但是也发不了大财。想求涨工资估计在本月财泻气之月无望，下个月财爻临合在财旺之日亦有希望，但是被兄弟通关亦难涨工资，在农历7月8月和9月希望都不大，估计至少要到今年冬天农历PN月和PP月财神源头水来生卯木财星之时比较有希望。其但是求财的原神子孙爻未上卦，做事少人帮，须靠自己的力量，也表示事物的发展缺乏原动力。不过其忌神兄弟亦偏弱，亦主所测事物遇外部阻力甚少，事情进展较为顺利。综合起来看就是个少阻力，也少人帮的局势，没有人帮求财难，没有阻力也难破财。此卦为平卦偏上，要求财，待到冬季来。	近期提升有限，等待良机为宜。另外此卦应爻和世爻卯戌相合，主利于与他人合作办事，可能有人与你合作事情能促进自身的发展，父母爻临应，应主他人，世主你自己，世应相合，主与你合作者是属于长辈或是上司等，这人对你是有利的，算的上贵人，一定要接受他的合作，并且与他保持良好的关系，对你的将来可能会有好的发展，所以总体来说你这次调动算是好的，是向着吉利的方向发展的，你尽量要去，这也许对你有利，只是暂时不一定看的到吉利的后果，但是以后等到水旺之时也许就会看到了。	Recent improvements are limited, and it is advisable to wait for a good opportunity. Additionally, this hexagram suggests the corresponding lines of the yin and yang and compatibility between mao and xu, indicating benefits in collaborating with others. There may be someone who can help facilitate your development through cooperation. The Parents line is at the yin position, symbolizing others, while the yang represents yourself. The harmony between the two signifies that your collaborator may be an elder or superior, someone beneficial to you. This person could be considered a benefactor; you should definitely accept their cooperation and maintain a good relationship with them. This could lead to positive developments for your future. Overall, this adjustment is promising, moving in a favorable direction, and you should proceed as it might benefit you. Although the favorable results might not be immediately visible, when the water phase becomes prominent, the benefits may become apparent.	Since the inquiry is about whether the job can lead to a salary increase and it involves financial prospects, the third line where Wife and Wealth is of wood in mao is used. The Wife and Wealth in mao wood presides, and although it is supposed to be auspicious with movement, unfortunately, the transformation of mao into gold in Shen counteracts and suppresses the position. The finance star in mao wood that presides the matter is also overcome by the day's clash and weakened in the lunar cycle, so the financial line and useful spirit are not robust, rather weak. Though there is finance and the wealth can be obtained, trying to gain large wealth is hindered by the Sibling overcoming wealth. Thus, the wealth attained will be through hard work. The internal hexagram's upper line in the third line for mao wood, which is active, suggests a rapid development, with fortunes and misfortunes easily noticeable and quickly fulfilled. Financial movement is indicated, but without a source, wealth cannot flourish unless water and wood come. This is expected to happen in the winter this year, with financially favorable terms in water and wood months. The White Tiger appearing in the finance and useful line activating suggests punishment, litigation, and illness, which is adverse. Even though finance has the presiding place as a favorable use, regrettably, it is counteracted by the transformation and daily clashes, making salary increase difficult. The original spirit for finance, the Children line, does not appear in the hexagram, meaning less assistance in doing things, relying more on personal strength, and indicating a lack of initial momentum in the development of affairs. The prohibiting spirit, Sibling, is relatively strong, making the financial challenge arduous, with no large fortune but little worry of major loss as the Sibling does not move. However, caution is advised for the lunar months of July and August, as these months in the Chinese calendar represent pure gold operations, suggesting unnecessary significant expenditures due to their flourishing financial robbing. Conversely, the financial prospects are relatively favorable in the lunar months of PN and PP. Seeking wealth finds no vigorous wealth god; Sibling robbing wealth does not move, and although monthly overcoming isn't strong, generally this suggests no major financial loss, yet no large wealth gain either. Expecting a salary increase is unlikely in the current month's financially depressing cycle; there may be hope next month during when finance resonates on wealth days; however, the Sibling intervention hinders salary increase, with minimal hope from lunar July to September, likely in winter during lunar months PN and PP when wealth sources from water positively influence mao wood finance star. Again, the financial original spirit, the Children line, does not appear in the hexagram with little external help and a need for self-reliance, showing lack of initial momentum. Yet, the prohibiting spirit, Sibling, is also weak, meaning little external resistance to matters, allowing smooth progress. All in all, it's a situation with low resistance and little aid; pursuing wealth is difficult without help, yet difficulty in major financial loss is also unlikely. This hexagram is an average plus, with the suggestion to wait for the winter to pursue wealth.	12	25	gui	1004	hai	si
2	流年财运如何？	1	How will the financial fortune of the coming year be?	丁亥年戊申月辛巳日	求财应以子水妻财为用神。此卦为子孙申金持世，妻财正好为应爻，世应分居卦之青龙朱雀，位居六爻之上下两位，并成申子半合之势，占据了该卦的所有重要位置。兄弟爻为忌神；虽动，但化退，且余力与世应构成申子辰三合财库，是化忌为用之象，预兆为所测之事皆逢凶化吉。同时，卦于日月劫财过旺，天时尤为不利；但变卦却又遇六合，妙在变卦六合巳申化水却也恰为妻财。又一得六合财之象。同时，卦变六合大多也是遇难成祥之象。	此卦的明显之处，强大的信息量告诉我们，无论是申子辰还是巳申；皆是化为水，水为本卦之财；正为命主所问之事，其气象具足，所以主卦和变卦都脱离不了财源兴旺的结果。正所谓用神兴旺，忌神无力。财气具足，求财得力。得到这种卦，必大利流年财运。求财虽非大富，但能稳步小积。建议控制开支，耐心等待更好财运到来。	The obvious aspect of this hexagram, with its powerful information, tells us that whether it is Shen, Zi, Chen, or Si, Shen; they all transform into water, with water being the wealth of this hexagram. This directly pertains to the matter inquired by the life master. The omens are perfectly present, so both the primary and transformed hexagrams cannot escape the result of prosperous financial resources. As the saying goes, the Beneficial Spirit thrives, while the Detrimental Spirit is powerless. Financial energy is abundant, making it conducive to seeking wealth. Receiving such a hexagram indicates great annual wealth fortune. Although the wealth pursuit may not lead to great riches, it allows for a steady accumulation of small gains. It is suggested to control expenses and patiently wait for better fortune to arrive.	To seek wealth, use water from the branch of Zi and Wife and Wealth as the useful deity. In this hexagram, the Children represented by Shen gold supports the world, and Wife and Wealth perfectly corresponds to the responding line. The world and the response are positioned in the Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird of the hexagram, occupying the upper and lower positions of the six lines and forming a half-combination of Shen and Zi. This dominates all significant positions in the hexagram. The Sibling line is the unfavorable deity; although it moves, it transforms into retreat, and its residual power forms a threefold combination with the world and the response, creating a financial treasury of Shen, Zi, and Chen. This signifies transforming the unfavorable into the useful, indicating misfortune turning into fortune in the matter being divined. Meanwhile, the hexagram with the sun and moon in overabundant wealth is especially disadvantageous; however, the transforming hexagram meets the Six Harmonies, cleverly coinciding with the transformation of Six Harmonies into water, which exactly aligns with the Wife and Wealth. This is another image of acquiring wealth through Six Harmonies. Moreover, when the hexagram transforms into the Six Harmonies, it often symbolizes encountering difficulties that turn into blessings.	5	48	xin	829	si	shen

总体来看，仍以吉断"	世动化财回头生合，财得日生可求，但空，不是马上见效益，卦变六冲，是表示不会永久做下去，总体看有利，但利不大。	The line representing the self moves and transforms into wealth, is regenerated and combined. The wealth is nourished by the day, making it possible to seek profit, but it is empty, indicating that immediate benefits are not seen. The hexagram changes to the six clashes, which indicates it will not be permanent. Overall, it appears beneficial, but the benefit is not great.	"The ruling line, You gold, is assisted by the month and controlled by the day, signifying prosperity. Representing new products essentially seeks wealth; hence, the wealth line acts as the useful spirit. Within the hexagram, the wealth line is associated with soil, which is dormant during the Shen month but fortunately revived by the establishment day, indicating prosperity. Wealth generates Demons in the ruling line, making the pursuit of wealth easier. There are three wealth lines in the hexagram: the top six wealth in Xu is at the response line, creating prosperity; this can be understood as the product being advantageous to oneself. The initial line represents Chou wealth transforming into Zi water Parents, forming a union driven by greed, but with the help of the establishment day, Wu fire breaks the union of Zi and Chou, allowing Chou wealth to nourish the ruling line. Moreover, this line is associated with the Azure Dragon, further enhancing auspiciousness. The third line, representing You gold's ruling line, transforms into Chen soil's wealth treasury, indicating that encountering wealth leads to obtaining it. However, in the Jiawu period, Chen and Si are empty; what does it imply when the ruling line transforms into emptiness? I am unclear. In the hexagram, the Sibling Yin wood acts as the harmful spirit, but it's broken and hidden under Parents Hai water, unable to harm the useful spirit. In the second line, Parents Hai water moves to form a union, driven by greed, forgetting to control and neither consuming nor depleting the ruling line, nor harming the original spirit of wealth, Wu fire. The hexagram changes into a six-conflict pattern, fearing that good fortune might disperse when faced with clashes. 

Overall, it is still interpreted as auspicious."	32	51	jia	375	wu	shen

It is recommended to collect more evidence and strengthen the defense. At the same time, stay calm and do not escalate conflicts. If the line representing Demons is in a state of rest and decline in the future, mediation can be attempted.	The line of the self is obstructed by the day branch, indicating that litigation is unfavorable to oneself. When the line of Demons is active and restrains the line of the self, it suggests that the opponent holds the upper hand in the lawsuit. The hexagram image shows that the line of the self is weakened by the month, necessitating the gathering of more evidence and patiently waiting for a favorable opportunity to counterattack.	44	6	gui	335	wei	chou
5	测升学	1	Divination for Academic Advancement	丁亥年丙午月庚辰日	"求功名首用父官两神，卦中官星不现，初爻父临日破，官父两神皆不得力；上爻父母虽动，又化财回头冲克之，父母虽动却临日破加化回头克，父母爻亦非常衰弱；用神无力且受损严重，卦象已有不吉。当大象不吉已成，看世爻有无补救；本卦世爻为兄弟持世，测升学考试兄弟爻持世乃本是不吉之象，盖兄弟代表同学，而持世即代表同学处于旺地，引申出竞争力必强盛，所以兄弟持世不利升学；再者兄弟乃泻父母之神，本卦父母爻临兄弟爻两爻皆动；兄弟使得已被化回头克和日破的父母爻再度泄气，故又能使父母爻更衰；用神更虚弱。
再看世应爻组合关系：兄弟持世生子孙应爻，子孙乃克官鬼之神，卦中无财星通关，如同四柱八字中伤官旺而无财一样，卦中结构忌见官星；而本卦测主所求测之事恰用神用官用印，而卦中官印又衰绝而伤官反旺故忌见官，用神一旦成忌神，格局破败无疑。
看卦象：卦逢反吟，凶多吉少。本卦最重要的两个爻：用神爻父母被化回头克即反吟；而世爻又化回头克即再逢反吟；实升学之事自然越顺畅越好，最怕夜长梦多，而反吟重重，本应是坎坷之象，再加上两最重要的核心爻神化反吟回头克，更是凶多吉少的象征。
看六神：青龙吉神虽临父母爻本应是吉，但是其恰恰不动又被日破而无力；兄弟凶神临世爻且动又临白虎位，主他人同学得势，自己不利。
既是升学，那么不妨也来看下与升学有关的最重要的神煞：甲木日文昌文曲在于巳酉；文昌星持世却被回头克又临兄弟，当日文昌在同学头上高照，对自己都不利。"	通过以上六点已知此卦求升学之艰难，如同涣散之师而求胜仗，难矣！学业进取道阻且长，唯有大力拼搏方可望顶。	Through the above six points, it is known that this hexagram indicates the difficulty of pursuing further studies, akin to a dispersed army seeking victory in battle—how difficult it is! The path of academic advancement is blocked and long; only with great effort and struggle can one hope to reach the top.	"For seeking fame and position, first use the two elements of Parents and Demons. If the Demonic star does not appear in the hexagram, and the initial line of Parents is weakened by the day, both Demons and Parents are powerless. Although Parents in the upper line are active, they transform into wealth and are again countered and weakened, making the Parents line extremely weak. When the element is weak and severely damaged, the hexagram has already shown inauspiciousness. When the grand form of inauspiciousness is established, observe if the world line offers any remedy. In the primary hexagram, the world line is held by Siblings. In the context of examinations, when Siblings hold the world line, it is intrinsically a sign of misfortune. Siblings represent classmates, and when holding the world line signifies classmates are in a prosperous position, implying formidable competition, making it disadvantageous for exams. Furthermore, Siblings deplete the energy of Parents. In this hexagram, the Parents line is intertwined with moving Siblings; the Siblings further exhaust the Parents line, already diminished by retrograde transformation and daily weakening, making it even weaker.

Observe the relationship between the world and the responding lines: Siblings holding the world line generate Children in the responding line. Children counteract Demons but, with no financial stars traversing through the hexagram, it resembles a situation where a prosperous Child star lacks wealth in the four pillars and eight characters, making the appearance of Demons undesirable. In this hexagram, the matter at hand involves the use of Demons, symbolizing authority and seals, but within the hexagram, the Demonic seal is weak and exhausted while the hurtful star is strong, making the appearance of Demons unwelcome. Once the element serving as the focal point becomes an undesirable entity, the pattern inevitably collapses.

Look at the hexagram form: when the hexagram encounters retrograde movements, the inauspicious outweighs the auspicious. The two most crucial lines of this hexagram: the primary line of Parents is transformed into a retrograde clashing, which is a retrograde movement; and the world line is also retrograde transformed and encounters yet another retrograde movement; indeed, the matter of examinations naturally benefits from smooth progress, but fears the endless worries, and with layers of retrograde movements, it was meant to be an indication of hardship. Coupled with the two most pivotal core elements being retrograde transformed into back-clashing, it further symbolizes more adversity than fortune.

Observe the Six Spirits: though the Azure Dragon auspicious spirit is with the Parents line, suggesting auspiciousness, it is inactive and weakened by the day, thus powerless; the ominous Sibling spirit rests on the world line, moving and additionally positioned in the White Tiger position, indicating that others, classmates, gain strength while the self is disadvantaged.

Since it pertains to examinations, it would be beneficial to also examine the most significant stars and spirits related to examinations: Jia Wood day, Wen Chang, and Wen Qu are situated in Si and You; Wen Chang star holds the world yet is retrograde clashed again by siblings, showing that on the mentioned day Wen Chang shines brightly over classmates but is disadvantageous to oneself."	59	7	geng	307	chen	wu

It is advised to prepare documentation in advance, communicate with relevant departments, and strive to submit the application at a favorable opportunity.	The hexagram is unfavorable. Although the Children line is active, it is subject to emptiness, which may hinder the handling of the stall-related matters. It is advised to make thorough preparations and patiently wait for the right opportunity before taking action.	3	29	gui	307	mao	chen
11	测儿子病何日好？	1	When will the illness of my son improve?	辛巳年丁酉月庚寅日	从卦象看，官鬼居金持世，应爻戌土上临西金有力，世爻火弱。测儿子病以申子孙爻为用神，挂中戊戌火为子孙爻，应爻戌土交西金为吉，但不宜子孙爻火受克，说明儿子病稍重。	官鬼金持世，说明为火过旺压制导致，世爻空亡待用。解读的结论表明，约在甲午日后儿子病好转。	Demons represented by gold hold the ruling line, indicating that excessive fire suppresses, causing the ruling line to lie dormant and wait for use. The interpretation concludes that around the day of jiawu, the son's illness will improve.	From the hexagram image, Demons occupy gold and take the position of the principal line, with the line at Xū soil overlain by western gold, showing strength, while the principal line's fire is weak. Inquiring about the son's illness, the Shēn Children line is used as the significant line. Within the hexagram, Wù Xū fire stands as the Children line, with the response line Xū soil interacting with western gold, which is auspicious. However, it is unfavorable that the Children line's fire is being subdued, indicating the son's illness is rather severe.	34	32	geng	239	yin	you

The month has the original spirit as the mother, breaking through the second line, which can indicate a weak sense of responsibility towards the family.	Parents are prosperous and favorable, so there should be no major issues at present. However, with the fifth line showing an isolated and transformed Parents leading to exhaustion, continued development in this direction would be unfavorable, and there is a possibility of separation.	27	42	yi	220	hai	shen

This hexagram indicates that the Demons are supported by both the day and the month. The original spirit, Wife and Wealth, and soil, transforms to return and generate. The unfavorable spirit, fire of Wu, does not appear in the hexagram. I conclude that it is excessively prosperous, but the world line is also the tomb and treasury of the Demons. This suggests that this action will completely terminate this relationship.	46	32	bing	208	shen	shen
12	一妇测其丈夫何日出狱？	1	A woman asked when her husband would be released from prison.	丁亥年丙子月丙申日	丈夫克世，但丑土为狱之象，官鬼申支持世，卦中有卯未子午辰，必用寅救灾之兆。	此卦说明不急，等待六日，看丙午日有消息。丈夫大概率两日内出狱，或晚上也可能获释。	This hexagram suggests not to rush, wait for six days, and observe for news on the bingwu day. The husband is highly likely to be released from prison within two days, or he might also be released at night.	The husband controls the world, but the soil of Chou represents the image of imprisonment. Demons of Shen support the world. Within the hexagram, there are Mao, Wei, Zi, Wu, and Chen. This definitely indicates a sign of using Yin to rescue from disaster.	12	23	bing	206	shen	zi

Additionally, it might be necessary to wait for the right moment.	Fire is below, the mountain is above. Fire symbolizes civilization, and can also signify literature and harmonizes with objects like the harmonica. The responding line xu serves as the fire's repository, and the si-xu alignment creates a six harmony fire situation. However, the upper trigram is gen, which represents the mountain, suppressing the brightness of the fire, as if light is being blocked by mountain peaks, making civilization inconspicuous. Fortunately, a mountain is a static object, an unmoving entity. The obstruction to its brightness is not caused by passing children, as children are active beings. This object is also something lost within the home, having not moved afar. The cyclical repetition between the brightness of fire and the gen peaks resembles a drawer at home; as it moves in and out, it reflects a cyclic pattern. The union between the moving and responding line is disrupted by the month's clash, the month's break causing damage, resulting in things not aligning with one's desires. Fortunately, in the search for the item, after the passing of the you month, the monthly break transforms back into six harmony, which is a good omen.	22	37	geng	193	yin	xu

The line representing the focus is activated by the Parents line, indicating that the day's fortune will be stable, without major disasters or difficulties.
