1,丢失的失物（口琴）能找回吗？,0,Can the lost item (a harmonica) be recovered?,戊戌年壬戌月庚寅日,离火在下，艮山在上。离火为文明之象，也可以象征为文艺，与口琴之物吻合。应爻戌为火库，卯戌世应亦是六合火局。唯上卦其象艮为山，则压伏离火之光明，犹如光明被山峰遮挡，文明不显。幸亏山为静物，乃不动之物。见遮挡其光明的并非来往小孩，因小孩为动者。此物又为家中遗失，未动则未能远离。离火之光明与艮峰之循环往复，此象很像家中抽屉，因其循环抽动则有往复之象。世应之合被月冲破，逢月破相伤，事与愿违。幸亏是寻找物体，待酉月过后，月破反化六合，则是吉兆。,物品可能遗失在室内偏隐位置，需家人帮忙方可找回，另可能需等待时机。,"The lost item may be in a hidden spot indoors and requires help from family members to find it. Alternatively, waiting for the right time may also be necessary.","Li Fire is below, Gen Mountain is above. Li Fire symbolizes civilization and can also represent the arts, aligning with objects like the harmonica. The responding line, Xu, is the storehouse of fire, and the interaction of Mao and Xu forms a hexagram of a harmonious fire circle. However, the upper trigram, Gen, represents a mountain, which suppresses the brightness of the Li Fire, akin to the light being obscured by a peak, causing civilization to be unmanifested. Fortunately, the mountain is a static entity, immobile. The obstruction to its brightness is not caused by children, as children are movers. This entity is again a lost item in the house; being immobile, it has not drifted far away. The cyclic nature of Li Fire's brightness and Gen Mountain is reminiscent of a drawer at home, as its repetitive motion mimics cycles. The conjunction of the subject and object is disrupted by the moon, and when the month breaks, it leads to injuries, and things deviate from desires. Fortunately, since it’s about searching for an object, after the You month passes, the broken month turns back into a hexagram of harmony, which is an auspicious sign.",22,37,geng
2,流年财运如何？,1,How will the financial fortune be this year?,丁亥年戊申月辛巳日,求财应以子水妻财为用神。此卦为子孙申金持世，妻财正好为应爻，世应分居卦之青龙朱雀，位居六爻之上下两位，并成申子半合之势，占据了该卦的所有重要位置。兄弟爻为忌神；虽动，但化退，且余力与世应构成申子辰三合财库，是化忌为用之象，预兆为所测之事皆逢凶化吉。同时，卦于日月劫财过旺，天时尤为不利；但变卦却又遇六合，妙在变卦六合巳申化水却也恰为妻财。又一得六合财之象。同时，卦变六合大多也是遇难成祥之象。,此卦的明显之处，强大的信息量告诉我们，无论是申子辰还是巳申；皆是化为水，水为本卦之财；正为命主所问之事，其气象具足，所以主卦和变卦都脱离不了财源兴旺的结果。正所谓用神兴旺，忌神无力。财气具足，求财得力。得到这种卦，必大利流年财运。求财虽非大富，但能稳步小积。建议控制开支，耐心等待更好财运到来。,"This hexagram indicates strong and abundant information, showing that the transformations align with the querent's question. The imagery is sufficient, and both the primary and transforming hexagrams point to thriving financial resources. The favorable elements are strong, while the opposing elements are weak. The financial prospects are abundant, and wealth acquisition is effective. Receiving this hexagram suggests favorable financial fortune for the year. While it may not lead to great wealth, steady and gradual accumulation is possible. It is advised to control spending and patiently wait for better financial opportunities.","To seek wealth, the Water element associated with the Wife/Fortune line should be used. This hexagram is represented by the Grandchild's Metal element signifying the Subject, while the Wife/Fortune line perfectly aligns with the Correspondent line. The positions of the Subject and Correspondent are found in the hexagram's Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird, located at the upper and lower positions of the six lines, respectively, and form a partial union of Shen and Zi. They occupy all the critical positions in the hexagram. The Brother line is an unfavorable element; although it is active, it transforms into retreat, and its residual energy forms a triad union with Shen, Zi, and Chen to create a treasury for wealth, symbolizing transformation from adversity to utility, predicting that the matter inquired will turn misfortune into fortune. Meanwhile, excessively strong robbery of wealth is high during the day and month, which is particularly unfavorable for timing; however, the changing hexagram encounters the Union of Six, fortuitously and transforms the Union of Six Si and Shen into Water, which appropriately represents the Wife/Fortune line. There is another symbol of gaining the Six Union's fortune. Additionally, the transition to the Union of Six in hexagrams often also signifies turning danger into safety.",5,48,xin
3,蓝翔技校是真的牛逼吗？,0,Is Lanxiang Technical School really that impressive?,甲午年癸酉月己酉日,世爻亥水动而冲应爻巳火，卦中金气生助世爻，六合金局稳固，整体趋势较吉，唯有小挫折。,整体环境支持学员发展，但需适应激烈竞争。,"The overall environment supports personal development, but one must adapt to intense competition.","The moving line in the position of the world corresponds with the water of the Hai clashes with the responding line of the Si fire. Within the hexagram, the metal element fosters and assists the line of the world, while the Six Harmonies metal configuration remains stable. The overall trend is quite auspicious, with only minor setbacks.",15,37,ji
4,工作去了后能否提升工资？,0,Will my family be stable and smooth after I leave?,戊子年丁巳月癸亥日,因为测问工作去了后能否提升工资，是为测财运，所以取 3爻妻财卯木为用，用神妻财卯木持世，卯木随虽动本应吉，但可惜卯化出申金劫财回头克世，世矛木财星又逢日冲破，事损克，在月亦处于泻气之地，所以财爻用神不旺，偏弱，持世主有财，能求到财，但是化兄弟克劫主求不了大财，所的之财为比较辛苦所得。其用爻卯木内卦上爻《第三爻》为动爻，主事情发展快，吉凶易见且应验迅速，财动有动之象，不见源财难旺，除非水木来临，而在今年水木之月要等到冬季，夏秋一般，到了今年冬季利财。白虎临财爻用神爻发动，白虎发动主刑伤，官司疾病不利，财虽然临世为喜用，但是可惜又化回头克和日冲劫，所以求工资难涨。其求财的原神子孙爻未上卦，做事少人帮，须靠自己的力量，也表示事物的发展缺乏原动力。忌神兄弟比较旺，劫财强于财星，所以求财辛苦，财不大，但是兄弟不动，亦不至于有什么大破财之忧，但是要注意下农历7月份和农历8月份，今年的农历七，八两个月为庚申，辛酉纯金之运，在这两个月要注意可能有为不必要的事情而花消大，是劫财临旺之月，因为。在农历PN月份和PP月份财运比较不错。求财财神不旺，兄弟劫财也不动，逢月克也不够旺，所以总体来看，不会破财，但是也发不了大财。想求涨工资估计在本月财泻气之月无望，下个月财爻临合在财旺之日亦有希望，但是被兄弟通关亦难涨工资，在农历7月8月和9月希望都不大，估计至少要到今年冬天农历PN月和PP月财神源头水来生卯木财星之时比较有希望。其但是求财的原神子孙爻未上卦，做事少人帮，须靠自己的力量，也表示事物的发展缺乏原动力。不过其忌神兄弟亦偏弱，亦主所测事物遇外部阻力甚少，事情进展较为顺利。综合起来看就是个少阻力，也少人帮的局势，没有人帮求财难，没有阻力也难破财。此卦为平卦偏上，要求财，待到冬季来。,近期提升有限，等待良机为宜。另外此卦应爻和世爻卯戌相合，主利于与他人合作办事，可能有人与你合作事情能促进自身的发展，父母爻临应，应主他人，世主你自己，世应相合，主与你合作者是属于长辈或是上司等，这人对你是有利的，算的上贵人，一定要接受他的合作，并且与他保持良好的关系，对你的将来可能会有好的发展，所以总体来说你这次调动算是好的，是向着吉利的方向发展的，你尽量要去，这也许对你有利，只是暂时不一定看的到吉利的后果，但是以后等到水旺之时也许就会看到了。,"This is a favorable hexagram. It turns misfortune into fortune, with external challenges but internal auspiciousness. There is no need for unnecessary worry.","Because the inquiry was about whether a salary raise can be achieved, it is considered a financial divination. Therefore, the third line, Wife Wealth Wood, is used as the significant line. The significant line of Wife Wealth Wood stands as the current aspect. While Wood moving generally suggests fortune, unfortunately, the change from Wood to Metal signifies a loss as it counters the significant line. The wealth star is also shattered by daily opposition, causing harm. During this month, it is also in a weakened position, so the financial line is not strong, rather weak. Although it holds prominence suggesting wealth is obtainable, it indicates hard-earned small wealth due to competition. The Wood line in the third position is active, suggesting rapid development, with quick and clear outcomes—financial movement signifies activity. Without the source wealth, flourishing is unlikely unless water and wood appear, which would happen in the winter months of this year. For summer and autumn, it is average, but during the winter of this year, prosperity in financial matters is expected.

The presence of the White Tiger with the financial and significant lines indicates movement. The White Tiger denotes punishment, legal issues, and illness, which is detrimental. Although wealth is present, it is regrettably countered by opposing forces and daily breaks, making salary increases difficult. The original spirit line of Offspring is not present, indicating little support from others and reliance on one's own efforts, further indicating a lack of initial momentum in tasks. The rival brothers are relatively strong, meaning wealth competition surpasses the wealth star, indicating hard-earned wealth. However, since the brothers are not moving, there is no great concern over losing major wealth. However, attention should be paid in the lunar months of July and August, during the Metal influence, which suggests unnecessary expenses due to strong wealth rivalry. In lunar months PN and PP, financial luck is relatively good. Though the Wealth divinity is not strong and rival wealth is not active, coupled with insufficient monthly impact, financial ruin is unlikely, but neither is substantial wealth. Expectation for a salary raise this month during the weakening of wealth is unlikely; next month, a possible favorable alignment for salary raise occurs when wealth aligns on a day when wealth is strong, but intervention by rivals makes the raise challenging. The hope is slim in July, August, and September, likely requiring until winter in lunar months PN and PP when Water nourishes the Wealth Wood star. Although help is scarce with original spirit lines absent, external resistance is limited, and tasks proceed smoothly.

Overall, it is a scenario with neither much resistance nor much help, making earning wealth challenging without assistance, but also lessening risk of loss due to absence of resistance. It is a neutral divination leaning slightly positive, suggesting financial pursuit awaits until winter.",12,25,gui
5,测升学,1,Will my salary increase after starting the new job?,丁亥年丙午月庚辰日,"求功名首用父官两神，卦中官星不现，初爻父临日破，官父两神皆不得力；上爻父母虽动，又化财回头冲克之，父母虽动却临日破加化回头克，父母爻亦非常衰弱；用神无力且受损严重，卦象已有不吉。当大象不吉已成，看世爻有无补救；本卦世爻为兄弟持世，测升学考试兄弟爻持世乃本是不吉之象，盖兄弟代表同学，而持世即代表同学处于旺地，引申出竞争力必强盛，所以兄弟持世不利升学；再者兄弟乃泻父母之神，本卦父母爻临兄弟爻两爻皆动；兄弟使得已被化回头克和日破的父母爻再度泄气，故又能使父母爻更衰；用神更虚弱。
再看世应爻组合关系：兄弟持世生子孙应爻，子孙乃克官鬼之神，卦中无财星通关，如同四柱八字中伤官旺而无财一样，卦中结构忌见官星；而本卦测主所求测之事恰用神用官用印，而卦中官印又衰绝而伤官反旺故忌见官，用神一旦成忌神，格局破败无疑。
看卦象：卦逢反吟，凶多吉少。本卦最重要的两个爻：用神爻父母被化回头克即反吟；而世爻又化回头克即再逢反吟；实升学之事自然越顺畅越好，最怕夜长梦多，而反吟重重，本应是坎坷之象，再加上两最重要的核心爻神化反吟回头克，更是凶多吉少的象征。
看六神：青龙吉神虽临父母爻本应是吉，但是其恰恰不动又被日破而无力；兄弟凶神临世爻且动又临白虎位，主他人同学得势，自己不利。
既是升学，那么不妨也来看下与升学有关的最重要的神煞：甲木日文昌文曲在于巳酉；文昌星持世却被回头克又临兄弟，当日文昌在同学头上高照，对自己都不利。",通过以上六点已知此卦求升学之艰难，如同涣散之师而求胜仗，难矣！学业进取道阻且长，唯有大力拼搏方可望顶。,"Recent opportunities for promotion are limited, and waiting for the right moment is recommended. Additionally, the hexagram shows a favorable interaction between the external factor and the self, suggesting benefits from collaborating with others. It indicates that a collaborator, possibly a senior or superior, may assist in personal growth. This person can be considered a benefactor. Maintaining a good relationship with this collaborator is crucial, as it may lead to positive outcomes in the future, though such benefits might not be immediately visible. Over time, when conditions improve, the results may become apparent.","To seek fame and position, one begins with the two spirits of father and official. If the official star does not appear in the hexagram, and the first line father suffers a daily break, then both spirits are ineffective. The upper line parents may be active, but they transform into wealth, causing conflict and suppression, resulting in the parents, though active, being weakened by the daily break and further damaged by transformation. The use spirit is weak and gravely damaged, indicating the hexagram is already unfavorable. When the overall image shows misfortune, examine the host line for any remedies. In the primary hexagram, the host line is held by brothers, which is inauspicious for exams. This is because brothers represent peers and competition is strong when brothers are in a thriving position, thus making it disadvantageous for exams. Furthermore, the brothers drain the parents’ spirit, with both parents’ lines in motion due to the brothers' influence. The brothers further drain the already disrupted and weakened parents, increasing their weakness, leading to an even weaker use spirit.

Next, observe the relationship between the host and the responder lines: brothers holding the host give birth to the offspring responder line, which clashes with the official ghost spirit. There is no finance star to bridge the gap, similar to a strong injury official without wealth in the four pillars Bazi, making the hexagram structure unfavorable for seeing the official star. The subject's inquiry involves the use of spirit, official, and seal, yet the official and seal in the hexagram are weak while the injury official is strong, making it undesirable to see the official. When the spirit becomes a taboo spirit, the pattern inevitably fails.

Examining the hexagram imagery: the hexagram encounters a reversed chant, indicating more misfortune than fortune. In this primary hexagram, the two most crucial lines— the parents’ spirit line transforms into a reversed chant caused by conflict, and the host line further transforms into a reversed chant. In the context of exams, smooth progress is desired, whereas an abundance of dreams signifies challenges. The repeated presence of reversed chants, with the two most vital core spirit lines being disrupted, spells more misfortune than fortune.

Regarding the Six Spirits: Although the auspicious Azure Dragon governs the parents’ line, suggesting fortune, it is inactive and suffers a daily break, rendering it powerless. The brothers’ ominous spirit governs the host line, is in motion, and occupies the White Tiger position, indicating that peers gain power while disadvantaging oneself.

Since it concerns academic advancement, let's consider the most vital deities associated with studies: Jia Wood Day's Wenchang and Wenqu occupy Si and You. The Wenchang star governs the host but is conflicted again and situated with the brothers. When the Sun Wenchang shines brightly on peers, it becomes disadvantageous to oneself.",59,7,geng

Mental preparation is necessary. It is advised to gather more evidence and strengthen the defense. Maintain composure and avoid escalating conflicts. If the situation weakens in the future, consider attempting mediation.","When the line representing the self is controlled by the ruling day, litigation is unfavorable to oneself. If the official line moves to overpower the self line, it indicates that the opposing party in the lawsuit is gaining the upper hand. The hexagram shows that the self line is in a monthly break, requiring more preparation of evidence and patiently waiting for a favorable opportunity to counterattack.",44,6,gui
8,到某地如何成功办一摊位？能批准否？,0,How can I successfully set up a stall at a specific location?

Flexibility in approach is required. It is recommended to prepare documents in advance, communicate with relevant departments, and apply when the timing is advantageous.","The hexagram is unfavorable, and although the descendants' line is activated, it is voided, so matters concerning setting up stalls may encounter obstacles.

11,测儿子病何日好？,1,When will my son's illness recover?,辛巳年丁酉月庚寅日,从卦象看，官鬼居金持世，应爻戌土上临西金有力，世爻火弱。测儿子病以申子孙爻为用神，挂中戊戌火为子孙爻，应爻戌土交西金为吉，但不宜子孙爻火受克，说明儿子病稍重。,官鬼金持世，说明为火过旺压制导致，世爻空亡待用。解读的结论表明，约在甲午日后儿子病好转。,"The ""official ghost"" (representing obstacles) holds the dominant position in this hexagram, indicating that excessive fire (overactivity) is suppressing it. The self-line is currently inactive and waiting to be used. The interpretation suggests that the son's illness is likely to improve around the day of Jiawu.","In terms of the hexagram image, the Official Ghost resides with metal and supports the subject, while the response line with Xu earth stands above the western metal with strength, and the subject line fire is weak. When divining about the son's illness, take the Shen child-and-grandson line as the significant line. In the hexagram, Wu Xu fire serves as the child-and-grandson line, and the response line Xu earth interacts positively with the western metal, which is auspicious. However, it is unfavorable that the child-and-grandson line fire is being overcome, indicating the son's illness is somewhat serious.",34,32,geng

The husband is highly likely to be released from prison within two days, possibly even at night.","A husband overcomes the world, yet the Chou Earth symbolizes imprisonment.
