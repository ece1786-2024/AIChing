4	0	After going to work, is it possible to get a salary raise?	Recent improvements are limited, and it is advisable to wait for a good opportunity. Additionally, this hexagram suggests the corresponding lines of the yin and yang and compatibility between mao and xu, indicating benefits in collaborating with others. There may be someone who can help facilitate your development through cooperation. The Parents line is at the yin position, symbolizing others, while the yang represents yourself. The harmony between the two signifies that your collaborator may be an elder or superior, someone beneficial to you. This person could be considered a benefactor; you should definitely accept their cooperation and maintain a good relationship with them. This could lead to positive developments for your future. Overall, this adjustment is promising, moving in a favorable direction, and you should proceed as it might benefit you. Although the favorable results might not be immediately visible, when the water phase becomes prominent, the benefits may become apparent.	Since the inquiry is about whether the job can lead to a salary increase and it involves financial prospects, the third line where Wife and Wealth is of wood in mao is used. The Wife and Wealth in mao wood presides, and although it is supposed to be auspicious with movement, unfortunately, the transformation of mao into gold in Shen counteracts and suppresses the position. The finance star in mao wood that presides the matter is also overcome by the day's clash and weakened in the lunar cycle, so the financial line and useful spirit are not robust, rather weak. Though there is finance and the wealth can be obtained, trying to gain large wealth is hindered by the Sibling overcoming wealth. Thus, the wealth attained will be through hard work. The internal hexagram's upper line in the third line for mao wood, which is active, suggests a rapid development, with fortunes and misfortunes easily noticeable and quickly fulfilled. Financial movement is indicated, but without a source, wealth cannot flourish unless water and wood come. This is expected to happen in the winter this year, with financially favorable terms in water and wood months. The White Tiger appearing in the finance and useful line activating suggests punishment, litigation, and illness, which is adverse. Even though finance has the presiding place as a favorable use, regrettably, it is counteracted by the transformation and daily clashes, making salary increase difficult. The original spirit for finance, the Children line, does not appear in the hexagram, meaning less assistance in doing things, relying more on personal strength, and indicating a lack of initial momentum in the development of affairs. The prohibiting spirit, Sibling, is relatively strong, making the financial challenge arduous, with no large fortune but little worry of major loss as the Sibling does not move. However, caution is advised for the lunar months of July and August, as these months in the Chinese calendar represent pure gold operations, suggesting unnecessary significant expenditures due to their flourishing financial robbing. Conversely, the financial prospects are relatively favorable in the lunar months of PN and PP. Seeking wealth finds no vigorous wealth god; Sibling robbing wealth does not move, and although monthly overcoming isn't strong, generally this suggests no major financial loss, yet no large wealth gain either. Expecting a salary increase is unlikely in the current month's financially depressing cycle; there may be hope next month during when finance resonates on wealth days; however, the Sibling intervention hinders salary increase, with minimal hope from lunar July to September, likely in winter during lunar months PN and PP when wealth sources from water positively influence mao wood finance star. Again, the financial original spirit, the Children line, does not appear in the hexagram with little external help and a need for self-reliance, showing lack of initial momentum. Yet, the prohibiting spirit, Sibling, is also weak, meaning little external resistance to matters, allowing smooth progress. All in all, it's a situation with low resistance and little aid; pursuing wealth is difficult without help, yet difficulty in major financial loss is also unlikely. This hexagram is an average plus, with the suggestion to wait for the winter to pursue wealth.	12	25	gui	1004	hai	si
2	1	How will the financial fortune of the coming year be?	The obvious aspect of this hexagram, with its powerful information, tells us that whether it is Shen, Zi, Chen, or Si, Shen; they all transform into water, with water being the wealth of this hexagram. This directly pertains to the matter inquired by the life master. The omens are perfectly present, so both the primary and transformed hexagrams cannot escape the result of prosperous financial resources. As the saying goes, the Beneficial Spirit thrives, while the Detrimental Spirit is powerless. Financial energy is abundant, making it conducive to seeking wealth. Receiving such a hexagram indicates great annual wealth fortune. Although the wealth pursuit may not lead to great riches, it allows for a steady accumulation of small gains. It is suggested to control expenses and patiently wait for better fortune to arrive.	To seek wealth, use water from the branch of Zi and Wife and Wealth as the useful deity. In this hexagram, the Children represented by Shen gold supports the world, and Wife and Wealth perfectly corresponds to the responding line. The world and the response are positioned in the Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird of the hexagram, occupying the upper and lower positions of the six lines and forming a half-combination of Shen and Zi. This dominates all significant positions in the hexagram. The Sibling line is the unfavorable deity; although it moves, it transforms into retreat, and its residual power forms a threefold combination with the world and the response, creating a financial treasury of Shen, Zi, and Chen. This signifies transforming the unfavorable into the useful, indicating misfortune turning into fortune in the matter being divined. Meanwhile, the hexagram with the sun and moon in overabundant wealth is especially disadvantageous; however, the transforming hexagram meets the Six Harmonies, cleverly coinciding with the transformation of Six Harmonies into water, which exactly aligns with the Wife and Wealth. This is another image of acquiring wealth through Six Harmonies. Moreover, when the hexagram transforms into the Six Harmonies, it often symbolizes encountering difficulties that turn into blessings.	5	48	xin	829	si	shen
26	0	Can a certain investment be made?	The line representing the self moves and transforms into wealth, is regenerated and combined. The wealth is nourished by the day, making it possible to seek profit, but it is empty, indicating that immediate benefits are not seen. The hexagram changes to the six clashes, which indicates it will not be permanent. Overall, it appears beneficial, but the benefit is not great.	"The ruling line, You gold, is assisted by the month and controlled by the day, signifying prosperity. Representing new products essentially seeks wealth; hence, the wealth line acts as the useful spirit. Within the hexagram, the wealth line is associated with soil, which is dormant during the Shen month but fortunately revived by the establishment day, indicating prosperity. Wealth generates Demons in the ruling line, making the pursuit of wealth easier. There are three wealth lines in the hexagram: the top six wealth in Xu is at the response line, creating prosperity; this can be understood as the product being advantageous to oneself. The initial line represents Chou wealth transforming into Zi water Parents, forming a union driven by greed, but with the help of the establishment day, Wu fire breaks the union of Zi and Chou, allowing Chou wealth to nourish the ruling line. Moreover, this line is associated with the Azure Dragon, further enhancing auspiciousness. The third line, representing You gold's ruling line, transforms into Chen soil's wealth treasury, indicating that encountering wealth leads to obtaining it. However, in the Jiawu period, Chen and Si are empty; what does it imply when the ruling line transforms into emptiness? I am unclear. In the hexagram, the Sibling Yin wood acts as the harmful spirit, but it's broken and hidden under Parents Hai water, unable to harm the useful spirit. In the second line, Parents Hai water moves to form a union, driven by greed, forgetting to control and neither consuming nor depleting the ruling line, nor harming the original spirit of wealth, Wu fire. The hexagram changes into a six-conflict pattern, fearing that good fortune might disperse when faced with clashes. 

Overall, it is still interpreted as auspicious."	32	51	jia	375	wu	shen
7	1	A woman consulted about a lawsuit.	The current situation of this lawsuit is not favorable, and psychological preparation is needed. It is recommended to collect more evidence and strengthen the defense. At the same time, stay calm and do not escalate conflicts. If the line representing Demons is in a state of rest and decline in the future, mediation can be attempted.	The line of the self is obstructed by the day branch, indicating that litigation is unfavorable to oneself. When the line of Demons is active and restrains the line of the self, it suggests that the opponent holds the upper hand in the lawsuit. The hexagram image shows that the line of the self is weakened by the month, necessitating the gathering of more evidence and patiently waiting for a favorable opportunity to counterattack.	44	6	gui	335	wei	chou
5	1	Divination for Academic Advancement	Through the above six points, it is known that this hexagram indicates the difficulty of pursuing further studies, akin to a dispersed army seeking victory in battle—how difficult it is! The path of academic advancement is blocked and long; only with great effort and struggle can one hope to reach the top.	"For seeking fame and position, first use the two elements of Parents and Demons. If the Demonic star does not appear in the hexagram, and the initial line of Parents is weakened by the day, both Demons and Parents are powerless. Although Parents in the upper line are active, they transform into wealth and are again countered and weakened, making the Parents line extremely weak. When the element is weak and severely damaged, the hexagram has already shown inauspiciousness. When the grand form of inauspiciousness is established, observe if the world line offers any remedy. In the primary hexagram, the world line is held by Siblings. In the context of examinations, when Siblings hold the world line, it is intrinsically a sign of misfortune. Siblings represent classmates, and when holding the world line signifies classmates are in a prosperous position, implying formidable competition, making it disadvantageous for exams. Furthermore, Siblings deplete the energy of Parents. In this hexagram, the Parents line is intertwined with moving Siblings; the Siblings further exhaust the Parents line, already diminished by retrograde transformation and daily weakening, making it even weaker.

Observe the relationship between the world and the responding lines: Siblings holding the world line generate Children in the responding line. Children counteract Demons but, with no financial stars traversing through the hexagram, it resembles a situation where a prosperous Child star lacks wealth in the four pillars and eight characters, making the appearance of Demons undesirable. In this hexagram, the matter at hand involves the use of Demons, symbolizing authority and seals, but within the hexagram, the Demonic seal is weak and exhausted while the hurtful star is strong, making the appearance of Demons unwelcome. Once the element serving as the focal point becomes an undesirable entity, the pattern inevitably collapses.

Look at the hexagram form: when the hexagram encounters retrograde movements, the inauspicious outweighs the auspicious. The two most crucial lines of this hexagram: the primary line of Parents is transformed into a retrograde clashing, which is a retrograde movement; and the world line is also retrograde transformed and encounters yet another retrograde movement; indeed, the matter of examinations naturally benefits from smooth progress, but fears the endless worries, and with layers of retrograde movements, it was meant to be an indication of hardship. Coupled with the two most pivotal core elements being retrograde transformed into back-clashing, it further symbolizes more adversity than fortune.

Observe the Six Spirits: though the Azure Dragon auspicious spirit is with the Parents line, suggesting auspiciousness, it is inactive and weakened by the day, thus powerless; the ominous Sibling spirit rests on the world line, moving and additionally positioned in the White Tiger position, indicating that others, classmates, gain strength while the self is disadvantaged.

Since it pertains to examinations, it would be beneficial to also examine the most significant stars and spirits related to examinations: Jia Wood day, Wen Chang, and Wen Qu are situated in Si and You; Wen Chang star holds the world yet is retrograde clashed again by siblings, showing that on the mentioned day Wen Chang shines brightly over classmates but is disadvantageous to oneself."	59	7	geng	307	chen	wu
8	0	How to successfully set up a stall somewhere? Can it be approved or not?	The changing line of Children indicates that the matter may eventually succeed, but the current resistance is significant, requiring flexible responses. It is advised to prepare documentation in advance, communicate with relevant departments, and strive to submit the application at a favorable opportunity.	The hexagram is unfavorable. Although the Children line is active, it is subject to emptiness, which may hinder the handling of the stall-related matters. It is advised to make thorough preparations and patiently wait for the right opportunity before taking action.	3	29	gui	307	mao	chen
11	1	When will the illness of my son improve?	Demons represented by gold hold the ruling line, indicating that excessive fire suppresses, causing the ruling line to lie dormant and wait for use. The interpretation concludes that around the day of jiawu, the son's illness will improve.	From the hexagram image, Demons occupy gold and take the position of the principal line, with the line at Xū soil overlain by western gold, showing strength, while the principal line's fire is weak. Inquiring about the son's illness, the Shēn Children line is used as the significant line. Within the hexagram, Wù Xū fire stands as the Children line, with the response line Xū soil interacting with western gold, which is auspicious. However, it is unfavorable that the Children line's fire is being subdued, indicating the son's illness is rather severe.	34	32	geng	239	yin	you
25	1	The emotional direction of Parents	Parents are prosperous and favorable, so there should be no major issues at present. However, with the fifth line showing an isolated and transformed Parents leading to exhaustion, continued development in this direction would be unfavorable, and there is a possibility of separation.	Parents are prosperous and favorable, so there should be no major issues at present. However, with the fifth line showing an isolated and transformed Parents leading to exhaustion, continued development in this direction would be unfavorable, and there is a possibility of separation.	27	42	yi	220	hai	shen
23	0	A woman asks if she should express to her boyfriend the desire to reconcile.	This hexagram can be viewed from two perspectives: the Demons are excessively strong, and the sole entry into the tomb is also a basis for this, so the possibility of the two people reconciling is very small.	This hexagram indicates that the Demons are supported by both the day and the month. The original spirit, Wife and Wealth, and soil, transforms to return and generate. The unfavorable spirit, fire of Wu, does not appear in the hexagram. I conclude that it is excessively prosperous, but the world line is also the tomb and treasury of the Demons. This suggests that this action will completely terminate this relationship.	46	32	bing	208	shen	shen
12	1	A woman asked when her husband would be released from prison.	This hexagram suggests not to rush, wait for six days, and observe for news on the bingwu day. The husband is highly likely to be released from prison within two days, or he might also be released at night.	The husband controls the world, but the soil of Chou represents the image of imprisonment. Demons of Shen support the world. Within the hexagram, there are Mao, Wei, Zi, Wu, and Chen. This definitely indicates a sign of using Yin to rescue from disaster.	12	23	bing	206	shen	zi
1	0	Can the lost item (harmonica) be recovered?	The item might be lost in a partially concealed location indoors, and assistance from family members is required to recover it. Additionally, it might be necessary to wait for the right moment.	Fire is below, the mountain is above. Fire symbolizes civilization, and can also signify literature and harmonizes with objects like the harmonica. The responding line xu serves as the fire's repository, and the si-xu alignment creates a six harmony fire situation. However, the upper trigram is gen, which represents the mountain, suppressing the brightness of the fire, as if light is being blocked by mountain peaks, making civilization inconspicuous. Fortunately, a mountain is a static object, an unmoving entity. The obstruction to its brightness is not caused by passing children, as children are active beings. This object is also something lost within the home, having not moved afar. The cyclical repetition between the brightness of fire and the gen peaks resembles a drawer at home; as it moves in and out, it reflects a cyclic pattern. The union between the moving and responding line is disrupted by the month's clash, the month's break causing damage, resulting in things not aligning with one's desires. Fortunately, in the search for the item, after the passing of the you month, the monthly break transforms back into six harmony, which is a good omen.	22	37	geng	193	yin	xu
10	1	A man's divination for the day's fortune	Today's activities are suitable for handling affairs or traveling. Overall fortunes are relatively smooth, but attention to detail is still necessary to avoid accidents caused by negligence.	The line representing the focus is activated by the Parents line, indicating that the day's fortune will be stable, without major disasters or difficulties. However, attention is needed as there may be minor setbacks or obstacles due to the Parents line's transformation overcoming the focus line.	25	39	wu	190	shen	si
124	0	Is it possible to find a friend with whom contact has been lost?	The friend you are looking for may take the initiative to contact you through a third party and restore your relationship.	The Sibling line is strong and active, indicating the friend's current situation is stable. The position line is supported by the day, suggesting that the querent needs to reestablish contact through close relationships.	45	37	geng	189	yin	wei
13	1	When will financial gain be realized?	The primary hexagram indicates that seeking wealth involves hardship, suggesting attention should be paid to the Sibling ruling the oracle to avoid signs of dispute. An auspicious omen.	To seek wealth, take the wealth line as the useful aspect, where the self line is financial and associated with mao, the self line combines with the month using wealth; amidst the hollow text of birth and control, gains can be achieved, but they are not plentiful.	22	53	jia	185	zi	si
24	0	A friend's phone was lost when they went out. The last time he used it was at someone else's house. Divined whether it can be retrieved?	Utilizing the concealed line, it is nearby. Gaining birth on the day is auspicious. The second line represents the house, and the third line represents the bedroom, the room.	The mobile phone takes Wife and Wealth as the useful spirit. I see it hiding under the world, it should be recoverable. Originally, it was judged that it would be restored on the day ruled by the Sibling conflict.	63	43	xin	174	mao	shen
60	0	Is it appropriate to buy a house this year?	It is advisable to purchase a house this year, as it is predicted that both the property options and prices will be favorable for you.	The Wife and Wealth line is prosperous and transforms auspiciously, indicating that the market environment is suitable for buying a house. The World line is stable, suggesting that the inquirer needs to consider long-term plans and avoid hasty decisions.	14	15	yi	164	wei	shen
15	1	How is the performance of the pawnshop business?	The moving line encounters a clash, and the wealth line suffers detriment, indicating an overall short-term disadvantage. It is advisable to adjust the strategy.	The line of the world is clashed by the day's branch, the wealth line is unstable, business operations need caution, and it should not be prolonged in the short term.	34	21	bing	161	wu	hai
59	0	Will friends fulfill their promises?	The friend will delay in fulfilling a promise but he will eventually complete it as agreed.	The Sibling line transforms and retreats, indicating that friends may not be able to fully fulfill their promises due to objective reasons. The self line is strong and supported by the response line, suggesting that the querent is willing to show more patience.	20	40	geng	159	xu	shen
162	0	Is it suitable to recruit technical personnel in the near future?	You should recruit now and you could find technical talents suitable for the team.	The Demons line is vigorous and active, indicating an abundance of technical talent resources. The subject line is static and transforms auspiciously, suggesting that the inquirer needs to clarify job responsibilities and compensation plans.	31	22	geng	159	yin	wu
