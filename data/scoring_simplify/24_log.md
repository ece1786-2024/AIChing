## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Well

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of the Well: To change the settlements without changing the water well is equivalent to doing nothing. People come and go by the well to draw water, and if the well becomes dry and silted without being cleaned, and instead, the water jar is broken—this is an omen of danger.		
		
The "Image" says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which symbolizes wood; the upper trigram is Kan, which symbolizes water. Water seeps downward and trees grow upward; this is the imagery of the Well hexagram. The noble person observes this image, takes inspiration from how well water nourishes people, and thus encourages the people to be diligent and to mutually encourage one another.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the stacking of different trigrams, with the lower being Xun and the upper being Kan. Kan represents water; Xun represents wood. Trees thrive and flourish when they have access to water. People rely on wells for water, and wells are created by human effort. There is mutual nourishment, as the well provides water to sustain people, and it is inexhaustible over time. People should learn from this virtue, diligently encouraging themselves in their endeavors.		
		
The Great Image: Water is absorbed by plants, nourishing the tree, symbolizing the act of drawing water from the well, which implies economy and repetition.		
		
Fortune: The well represents something static and immovable, so one should not be overly aggressive or enterprising in their actions and should avoid a lack of vigor. Handling matters calmly and steadily is more beneficial.		
		
Career: The situation is stable. One should neither advance rashly nor retreat, but should instead strive positively to learn and improve oneself, increasing personal strength and preparing for opportunities, which will lead to great achievements. The greatest fear is stagnation, as it may result in being deemed obsolete.		
		
Business: The market is favorable, and one can continue following the original strategy. Continue with a spirit of diligence and advancement, sincerely exploring the market. Pay special attention to cooperation with others, assisting each other, enriching and accumulating experiences in practical activities.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With proper intentions to contribute to society, one should study diligently. Special attention should be given to seeking guidance from virtuous and capable people, which could lead to recognition and recommendation.		
		
Marriage and Love: There is no need to rush; a suitable partner will appear in due course.		
		
Decision Making: Be intelligent, quick-witted, and willing to help others. There will also be opportunities to fully exhibit one's talents. By embracing the spirit of the "water well," sincerely dedicating oneself and continually enriching one's abilities, society will surely value this contribution.
- Scholar Interpretation: Still waters flow from the source, with a calm and steady movement; maintaining an unchanging position, preserving the status quo. Those who receive this hexagram should cultivate their character and nurture their nature, go with the flow, remain composed and serene; calmness brings benefit, while movement leads to misfortune.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:		
		
Fortune: Wood and water generate each other, fame and achievement are hopeful. 		
Wealth: Profit exceeds the capital, naturally pleasing. 		
Home: Repair the house and prevent water damage; yin and yang are balanced. 		
Health: The kidneys are excessively bloated, immediate treatment is necessary.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Splitting Apart

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Bo: It is unfavorable to undertake anything.		
		
The "Xiangci" (Commentary on the Image) says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The mountain rests on the earth, and wind and rain erode it; this is the image of the Bo hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, taking the warning from the falling of mountain rocks and the crumbling of cliff edges, thereby strengthening the unity and loyalty of the people, enabling them to live and work in peace and contentment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of dissimilar trigrams (with Earth below and Mountain above). Five yin lines are below, with one yang line above, representing an abundance of yin and a solitary yang; a high mountain rests on the earth. Both signify the concept of peeling away, hence it is known as the "Hexagram of Splitting Apart." In this hexagram, yin flourishes while yang declines, metaphorically indicating a time when petty people gain influence and virtuous people are in distress, leading to the ruin of enterprises.		
		
Great Image: The mountain resting upon the earth symbolizes mountains and stones collapsing to the ground, with five yin lines pressuring one yang, causing justice to be damaged.		
		
Fortunes: Misfortune surrounds you, suggesting the need to reorganize. Avoid being overconfident to prevent being implicated by women and petty individuals.		
		
Career: The times are unfavorable and driven by great trends, meaning an individual can only adapt to situations and pause actions, observing changes without taking risks. It is essential to actively create conditions, build strength, and remain cautious and patient, avoiding collaboration with petty people. The turning of fortunes will inevitably lead to accomplishing goals in the near future.		
		
Business: Having transitioned from a peak to a downturn entering a period of recession, it is essential to earnestly summarize experiences and lessons, implementing reorganizations, especially avoiding rash decisions. When favorable conditions arise, exploit them to smoothly and confidently reemerge.		
		
Seeking Recognition: The likelihood of success is low, so persistent pursuit is inadvisable. Instead, continue to create opportunities, strive to improve oneself, and enhance social skills, strengthening capabilities to seize the chance for a comeback.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Considerations must be thorough; unless a match is exceedingly suitable, do not proceed carelessly. Both parties should maintain family harmony.		
		
Decision-Making: Life is fraught with twists, often leading to unfavorable or even dire circumstances. Yet, there is a chance for revival from dire situations. By calmly analyzing situations and struggling tenaciously, one will certainly transform their fate, achieving admirable outcomes that evoke envy in others. The key is to avoid hastily seeking success, and particularly avoiding taking risks. Adapt to the trends and guard against sabotage by petty individuals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Exploitation and decay, the worry of disaster; advancement is difficult to achieve, stop in accordance with the times. For those who receive this hexagram, the time and fortune are not favorable, leading to many losses and obstacles to progress. It is advisable to stop in accordance with the times and maintain one’s duty. Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan: Fortune: The time and fortune are not favorable; maintain peace of mind and your place. Wealth: Profit from exports, exploiting others' wealth. Home: Do not leave your own home; buying a temporary residence is possible. Health: The soul is not attached, be extremely careful.

The broken hut of the petty person that fails to shield against wind and rain signifies ultimately being unable to maintain peace and safety.

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Significator hidden in the Self line indicates that the item may be concealed in a familiar place. The Wealth line transforming to retreat suggests that retrieving the watch may require patience.  

        Here's the information about the hexagram(s) I got:

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: After Completion

### General Information

- Description: Ji Ji Hexagram: Success. This is a divination that shows slight initial prosperity. Initially favorable, but eventually changes will occur. 		
		
The Xiangci (Commentary on the Symbolism) states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Kan, representing water; the lower trigram is Xun, representing fire. Water above, fire below, water douses fire, which is the imagery of the Ji Ji hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram and thus prepares during times without trouble, preventing calamity before it happens.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Kan above) stacked together. Kan represents water, and Li represents fire. Water and fire interact, with water above fire, overpowering the fire, successfully achieving the task of extinguishing it. "Ji" means "already"; "Ji" means "accomplished." Ji Ji signifies that things have already succeeded, but change is bound to occur eventually.		
		
The Great Image: Kan water is above Li fire. The nature of water is to move downward, while the fire tends to rise upward. When water and fire collaborate, it signifies completion.		
		
Fortune: A symbol of gaining both fame and profit, success is indicated. However, one must guard against the principle of extremes leading to reversal; initially prosperous but potentially leading to misfortune later.		
		
Career: Everything is smooth and prosperous, and even great achievements may have been accomplished. The key issue is how to maintain this momentum. It's essential to understand the truth that fortune peaks before decline, to anticipate and prevent future troubles, and to take measures before problems arise. Simultaneously, one must closely monitor the situation, seize favorable opportunities, continue to strive upward, and advance career development.		
		
Business: Benefitting from favorable market conditions, much profit has already been earned. However, this also signifies potential crises at any moment. Therefore, one must be careful and proactive, preventing issues before they arise, staying vigilant and cautious throughout the day. Additionally, actively observe market changes, adjust strategies accordingly, and explore new markets.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: The basic conditions for personal pursuit of fame and profit are already in place. It is crucial to prevent becoming rigid and conservative, which could lead to failure and abandonment halfway.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Initially smooth, but obstacles may arise midway.		
		
Decision-making: All conditions are excellent, and the environment is favorable for growth. However, this may lead to self-satisfaction, causing one to stop progressing or even become decadent and decline. One must continuously work hard, maintain humble virtues, keep a vigilant mindset, and prevent unexpected incidents.		
		
The Ji Ji hexagram is a hexagram of stacked opposites, with Li below and Kan above. Kan represents water and Li represents fire; when water and fire interact, water is above fire, overpowering the fire, completing the task of extinguishing it. "Ji" means "already"; "Ji" means "accomplished." Ji Ji signifies that things have already succeeded, but change is bound to occur eventually.		
		
The Ji Ji hexagram follows the Xiao Guo hexagram, as explained in the "Sequence of Hexagrams": "One who overcomes minor faults can achieve success, thus Ji Ji follows." Correcting minor errors leads to success, hence the discussion of the Ji Ji hexagram.		
		
In "The Image," this line explains: Water is above fire, Ji Ji; the gentleman uses foresight to prevent problems. It points out: The imagery of Ji Ji – Li (fire) below and Kan (water) above, with water over fire – symbolizes cooking food with fire, indicating that the food is cooked, representing the success of a matter; a gentleman should have a far-seeing perspective and, after success, consider potential drawbacks and prevent them before they occur by taking precautionary measures.		
		
Ji Ji symbolizes success, enlightening the truth that prosperity inevitably leads to decline. This hexagram is considered a moderately favorable one. "The Image" states: "Your name will be inscribed above the Golden List, not wasted was the effort of past hard work. For those who encounter this hexagram, fame and celebration are auspicious; everything aimed for will be successful and prosperous."
- Scholar Interpretation: Assistance and accomplishment, resolute and self-respecting; transitioning from large to small to ensure flourishing luck.		
		
For those who receive this hexagram, success in career is indicated, with a symbol of achievement. However, it is crucial to guard against decline after prosperity, and retreat is considered auspicious. Further advancement would be inauspicious.		
		
Fortune: Excessive prosperity will inevitably decline, be cautious of future troubles.		
		
Wealth: Acting promptly can yield profits.		
		
Home: A grand house can be inhabited; a harmonious hundred-year union.		
		
Health: Just recovering from a serious illness, still requires self-care.

Not believing in others’ warnings indicates good hearing, but a lack of understanding.

    - Description: Nine in the fifth position: The Yin people make grand sacrifices to the spirits and deities with cattle, but it is not as effective as the Zhou people's modest offerings to the spirits and deities.

To interpret the hexagram you provided, we'll follow the process outlined in the examples and apply the principles of the I Ching.

## Hexagram Analysis

Hexagram: After Completion (Ji Ji) - This hexagram indicates a state of success and conclusion but suggests that after reaching completion, changes are inevitable. It symbolizes balance and harmony, with water above fire, implying interactions that can extinguish each other's forces.

### Line Analysis

- **Line 1**: Element is wood, associated with Children. It indicates an initial disturbance or a minor issue, yet no serious calamity is intended.
- **Line 2**: Element is soil, associated with Demons. Represents concerns or misfortunes that are temporary, with the potential for them to be resolved or reclaimed.
- **Line 3**: Element is water, associated with Sibling. This indicates efforts or struggles that require patience and persistence before achieving a resolution.
- **Line 4**: Element is gold, associated with Parents. It brings anxiety or caution.
- **Line 5**: Element is soil, associated with Demons. Indicates offerings or attempts being insignificant initially, but perhaps important in other unexpectedly beneficial ways.
- **Line 6**: Element is water, associated with Sibling. Suggests a struggle or difficulty that may lead to potential danger if prolonged.

## Example Interpretation Analysis

Let's analyze step by step how the examples arrive at their interpretation.

**Example 1**:

- Focus on the status of the significator, assessing whether it is strong or weak.
- The Wealth line isn’t prominent, suggesting waiting patiently for news.
- The interpretation relies heavily on the status of the Parents and Wealth lines.
  
**Example 2**:

- Identification of the significator in the Self line as a concealed item.
- The change of wealth line to suggest retreat, implying patience is needed.
- Both examples emphasize waiting, indicating patience in retrieving lost items.
  
<analyze>
Example 1 involves determining where the lost item might be based on the significator resting on the day structure, which indicated the item is still within the home and advises careful searching. The absence of the wealth line indicates waiting is preferable. Example 2 uses the indication of concealment in a familiar place and reference to the wealth line transformation, advising patience. Both emphasize lines relating to retention and searching, with attention to status and element associations.
</analyze>

## Interaction and Reasoning

We shall now analyze the current hexagram to see if the lost phone can be retrieved.

1. **Determine the Significant Line**: The primary focus should be on the positions that signify the retrieval aspect, possibly the second or third line due to their association with 'loss and regain.'

2. **Assessing the Significator's Strength**: 
   - **Line 2** (“A woman has lost her headscarf…within seven days, it can be regained without seeking.”) aligns closely with the nature of retrieving something lost without overly exerting effort. The indication is the temporary nature of loss and a natural return.

3. **Changed vs. Static Lines**:
   - Line 2 changes to indicate an enemy that is noticeable but ultimately harmless. This may signify that any obstacles or confusion about the lost phone are addressable.
   
4. **Interactions with Elements**:
   - The symbolic elements reflect the need for care and consideration. Line 2 (soil) in particular suggests stability, implying recovery is possible.

5. **Overall Hexagram Image**:
   - With ‘After Completion’, the message is that success is within reach, but transformation awaits. Since portions of this hexagram signify being cautious and awaiting success, staying alert and organized may provide clarity and lead to recovery.

**Conclusion**: The hexagram indicates that while the phone is currently lost, there's a potential for its recovery without needing intense efforts. The symbolism suggests the importance of allowing the situation to resolve naturally over time.

<reason>
In this interpretation, the focus is on Line 2, related to loss and natural recovery, which serves as the significator. The overall image of 'After Completion' emphasizes patience in awaiting success. The transformation and associations with moderately favorable elements imply a positive outcome.
</reason>

The process is carefully guided by the principles of the I Ching, employing a detailed line-by-line analysis and elemental interactions to provide an interpretation concerning your situation.
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram "After Completion" suggests that your friend's lost phone can be retrieved. The key indication is the natural recovery represented by the second line, which implies that the phone will return to its owner without requiring intense effort. The situation calls for patience; allow time for events to resolve naturally, and keep a watchful but relaxed approach. Expect possible recovery within about a week, likely through rediscovery in familiar surroundings.

TERMINATE
Standard Answer: Utilizing the concealed line, it is nearby. Gaining birth on the day is auspicious. The second line represents the house, and the third line represents the bedroom, the room.
