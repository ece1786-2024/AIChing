## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gu: Great fortune and prosperity. It is beneficial for crossing water or rivers, but one must begin the journey on a day of Xin three days before the day of Jia or on a day of Ding three days after the day of Jia.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing the wind. The virtuous person resides like a mountain at the top, spreading moral teachings below. This is described as the wind beneath the mountain, an image of the Xun hexagram. A noble person observing this hexagram takes inspiration from the wind that blows across all things, rescuing the populace and implementing moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: The hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Xun, above is Gen) stacked together and is mutually complementary with the Sui hexagram. The original meaning of Gu is matter, which extends to trouble and chaos. Vessels that remain unused for a long time breed worms, symbolizing a world that has been stable for too long and has grown stagnant and corrupt, necessitating innovation, creation, governance, rectification, crisis resolution, and revitalization of business.		
		
The Image: The wind enters beneath the mountain, closed without exit, leading to decay and breeding of worms. Enthusiasm is blocked, leading to ruin through stagnation.		
		
Fortune: Everything is unsatisfactory, difficult, and confusing. It is advisable to make bold innovations; otherwise, it will lead to domestic and foreign troubles.		
		
Career: Luck is in a poor state, either due to external conditions or personal factors. Only by careful analysis of the reasons and identifying the drawbacks, with decisive and bold action, even at the risk of adventure, can obstacles be overcome. At this time, one must keep a calm mind and consult with wise people to create achievements.		
		
Business: Many disadvantages are troubling you, and it is not advisable to continue on the old path. A comprehensive analysis of market trends is needed to make decisive changes and seek alternative routes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Many difficulties and disadvantages will be encountered, which should be viewed as tests of oneself. With exceptional courage, continue to strive, while also humbly searching for one’s shortcomings and remedying them.		
		
Marriage and Love: Unsuccessful. If both parties are in love, they should go all out to bring about this matter, with the couple working together to maintain the family.		
		
Decision-Making: Born out of time, the family's or career's decline is evident, and one is in a troublesome period. Only by facing reality, being diligent, persevering, and achieving something, even at the risk of adventure, can the declining situation be salvaged. It is also necessary to patiently wait for the right opportunity when required.
- Scholar Interpretation: Three vessels are in ruin; things fall apart. With diligence and care, transformation from danger to safety is possible. For those who receive this hexagram, it is a time of difficulty and confusion, where nothing goes as desired. It is advisable to be bold in innovation, strive for improvement, and work hard, for danger can be transformed into safety.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Peirong:		
		
Timely fortune: Strive to make progress; old perspectives can change.		
		
Wealth: Accumulation is not advisable; sell promptly.		
		
Home: Rectify family conduct; be wary of personal affairs; childbirth may be problematic.		
		
Health: Poisonous ailments; be cautious of curses.

The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.
        - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Parents

The "Xiang" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.
        - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth
        - Status: Prime

## Hexagram Interpretation

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Difficulty at the Beginning

### General Information

The Commentary on the Image states: The upper trigram of Tun is Kan, representing clouds, and the lower trigram is Zhen, representing thunder. Clouds move above, and thunder moves below, forming the image of the hexagram Tun. The noble person observes this hexagram's image and emulates the qualities of clouds and thunder, using the grace of clouds and the majesty of thunder to govern state affairs.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the superimposition of different trigrams (Zhen below, Kan above). Zhen represents thunder, symbolizing movement; Kan represents rain, symbolizing danger. The combination of thunder and rain indicates a tumultuous and perilous situation with a harsh environment. Originally, "Tun" referred to the sprouting of plants on earth, the beginning of all things, full of difficulties and obstacles. However, if one goes with the times and responds appropriately, prosperity is inevitable.		
		
Great Image: "Tun" signifies difficulty, as everything is attempting to proceed but cannot advance.

Hence, one should frequently offer favors in ordinary times.		
		
Business: At the start of an enterprise, the path is difficult with many setbacks. Firm belief is most important. One should not be misled by surface appearances, but strive forward with decisiveness to find a way out. If difficulties persist, it is advised to retreat and safeguard, awaiting the opportunity for future plans.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Actively strive and pursue, success is attainable.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Good things come with difficulties, but with fidelity and purity, bold pursuit will lead to success and a happy marriage.

Often, lack of understanding from others can lead to loneliness and distress, leaving one's career in a difficult state. Assistance from virtuous people is required to overcome this. If one can live with an optimistic spirit, achievements can be made.
- Scholar Interpretation: All things begin to come into life with initial difficulty; first labor and then ease, bitterness is followed by sweetness. Those who receive this hexagram find themselves in a predicament, it is better to hold steady rather than advance, requiring much hard work and effort to overcome difficulties, only then can they achieve success, embodying the notion of initial difficulty followed by resolution. 		
		
Fortunes: Better to hold steady than to advance.		
Financial luck: Starting a business is arduous.		
Home: Repair the dwelling; initial marriage discord.		
Health: Preserve vitality.

The hexagram is unfavorable. Although the Children line is active, it is subject to emptiness, which may hinder the handling of the stall-related matters. It is advised to make thorough preparations and patiently wait for the right opportunity before taking action.

**Here's my question: How to successfully set up a stall somewhere? Can it be approved or not?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

### Example 1 Analysis:

1. **Identify the Significator (Six Relations):** 
   - The question is about purchasing property, relevant to the Parents line, which is a key indicator for properties or assets.

2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator:**
   - The Parents line is active and described as prosperous.
   - The activity suggests favorable conditions for achieving the goal related to property.

3. **Shi (世) and Ying (应) Lines:**
   - The Shi line is associated with the seeker, and it is important to seize opportunities.
   - The primary focus is on the prosperous Parents line.

4. **Hexagram Image Analysis:**
   - The primary hexagram suggests initial difficulty but potential success with careful and innovative actions.
   - The transformation might imply miss becoming opportunities if one isn't proactive.

Overall, the interpretation directed towards the property indicating that conditions were ideal due to the active and prosperous Parents line, a key factor in the outcome.

### Example 2 Analysis:

1. **Identify the Significator (Six Relations):**
   - The question on setting up a stall relates to the Children line, often associated with new ventures or businesses.

2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator:**
   - The Children line is mentioned as being active but subject to emptiness, indicating obstacles to starting the business venture.

3. **Shi (世) and Ying (应) Lines:**
   - Focus shifts to the need for preparation and patience, reflecting the need in the situation.

4. **Hexagram Image Analysis:**
   - The primary hexagram reflects initial difficulties and adversity.
   - Troubles are expected initially, but perseverance and preparation can lead to eventual success.

The interpretation concluded with a recommendation for preparation and patience, aligning with the hexagram's indication of initial struggle.

<analyze>
Analyzing both examples, I noticed that identifying the proper lines and their conditions plays a role in understanding the possible outcomes, and how well the energy of specific lines supports or hinders the endeavor in question. The examples closely followed the interactions between the lines, the strength or weakness of significant elements, and the structural interpretation of the hexagrams.

Now, I will proceed to interpret the current hexagram and lines presented for your question. 
</analyze>

<reason>
### Hexagram Analysis for the Current Question:

1. **Identify the Significator (Six Relations):**
   - The question relates to setting up a stall, connecting it to an entrepreneurial venture, thus indicating that the Children line should be the Significator as it often symbolizes new projects and commercial ventures.

2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator:**
   - In the primary hexagram, the Line 2 (relation: Children) is initially confined, but becomes prosperous in transformation.
   - This suggests obstacles but potential for eventual progress.

3. **Shi (世) and Ying (应) Lines:**
   - Line 4 is the Shi line, relevant for actions and advancement in your situation.
   - Line 1 is the Ying line, initially the line suggests static conditions but changes may pose caution.

4. **Hexagram Image Analysis:**
   - The hexagram "Difficulty at the Beginning" traditionally symbolizes initial struggle but with strategic perseverance, can culminate in success.
   - Emphasizes cautious but bold progression with due considerations.

The hexagram, in this context, recommends taking carefully planned actions with readiness to confront obstacles, which align with the line movements that suggest confinement transforming into prosperity. While initial adversity is clear, patience and preparation will guide this venture towards potential success. It is overall cautious optimism, suggesting that approval or successful establishment might be delayed, but remains attainable.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram "Difficulty at the Beginning" suggests serious initial challenges in setting up your stall. While initial efforts may face obstacles and seem unyielding, perseverance and careful planning can eventually lead to success. The indication is not immediate approval, but an opportunity for success with time and preparation. Seek advice, proceed cautiously but confidently, and allow patience to be part of your strategic approach.

It is advised to prepare documentation in advance, communicate with relevant departments, and strive to submit the application at a favorable opportunity.
