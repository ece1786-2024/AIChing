## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Opposition

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Kui: When this hexagram is encountered in divination, it is auspicious for small affairs. 		
		
The Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Li, which symbolizes fire, and the lower trigram is Dui, which symbolizes marsh. Fire above and marsh below, the two are separated, representing the symbolism of Hexagram Kui. The exemplary person observes this hexagram image and thus synthesizes the commonalities of all things and analyzes the differences among everything.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a combination of different trigrams (below is Dui, above is Li). Li represents fire; Dui represents a lake. With fire above and lake below, they contradict and do not support each other. Conflict leads to new creation, with no stagnation in forward and backward movements. Everything has its differences, and inevitably there exist contradictions. Kui symbolizes contradiction.		
		
Great Image: Li fire moves upward, Dui lake moves downward, one ascending and one descending, they oppose each other. Additionally, the image is of two women dwelling together, showing a lack of proper order.		
		
Fortune: The overall fortune is lacking, and it is difficult to accomplish things, reflecting the incompatibility of water and fire. It is advisable to stay calm and composed amidst changes.		
		
Career: Starting a career is difficult, and the situation is tough. However, if you can be like-minded and have mutual trust, your goals can be achieved. Initially, small successes are common, and these small achievements can accumulate into larger ones. Success comes from united effort and cooperation, but failure comes from differing wills. It is important to strengthen unity, and seek mutual understanding through compromises, avoiding internal suspicion.		
		
Business: Enter market competition with a calm and harmonious attitude, seeking commonalities while preserving differences. Do not be hostile toward competitors; maintain harmony without being excessively accommodating or partisan. Avoid causing disputes and strive to prevent disasters.		
		
Fame: Strive to advance sincerely. Even with bad people, do not avoid all interactions when necessary; adopt a forgiving and accommodating approach, and engage moderately. With like-minded individuals, complete agreement is not necessary; seek common ground amidst differences.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: Both parties must be sincere with one another. Otherwise, a third party can easily intervene, leading to suspicion between the couple and potentially the breakdown of the family.		
		
Decision-making: In a state of contradiction and opposition. It is essential to face life with tolerance, calmness, and gentleness. Only then can you maintain peace of mind and progress gently. Understand the principle that union involves separation, and separation involves union; within sameness, there are differences, and within differences, there are similarities. Otherwise, excessive rigidity leads to irritability, and excessive clarity leads to doubt. Both rage and suspicion can be fatal.
- Scholar Interpretation: When people's hearts are outwardly directed, they go against the path; it's difficult to accomplish things, not suitable for major undertakings. Those who receive this hexagram have bad luck; water and fire are incompatible, mutually contradicting, making all matters difficult to achieve.		
		
Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese National Studies:		
		
Fortune: Communication between high and low is blocked, handle it with righteousness.		
		
Wealth: What others abandon, I take; there is still a small profit.		
		
Residence: It's advisable to move away; choose carefully whom to marry.		
		
Health: Heat above and dampness below, truly difficult to treat.

### Line Information

    - Description: First Nine: There is no need for remorse. Even if you lose a horse, there is no need to search for it; it will return of its own accord. Even encountering bad people along the way will not lead to misfortune.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The reason there is no misfortune upon meeting bad people is to eliminate the ill intent of malefactors.

The cart-driver is a slave who has been branded on the forehead and had his nose cut off. Initially, the cart is stuck and doesn’t move, but eventually, it starts to pull forward.		
		
The "Xiang Commentary" says: Seeing a slave with a branded forehead and a cut nose pulling the cart symbolizes the line image: the third six being a yin line in a yang position, which is not appropriate, like a person falling into a pitiful situation. Initially, there's misfortune, but the ending turns out well because the third six, a yin line, advances to encounter the fourth nine, a yang line, like a person receiving help from a strong individual.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Family

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Family: Inquiring about matters concerning women is auspicious.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which represents wind; the inner trigram is Li, representing fire. Internally, fire; externally, wind. Wind assists the fire's strength, and fire enhances the wind's power, complementing each other—this is the image of Family. Observing this hexagram, the noble person realizes that words must have substance to avoid emptiness, and virtues must be sustained continuously to be abundant.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Xun above) stacked. Li represents fire; Xun represents wind. Fire causes heat to rise and become wind. All things should begin with an inner foundation before extending outward. Occurrences originate internally and form externally, symbolizing the idea of governing the household first before governing the realm. When the household is righteous, the world is peaceful and happy.		
		
Great Image: The image of wind blowing on fire, enhancing the power of fire, symbolizes family members working together with a united effort to develop their enterprise.		
		
Fortune: Great peace and good fortune, cooperation with others is easily successful, and there are signs of celebration, such as having children or marriages.		
		
Career: Success depends on the condition of the household. Strictly managing the household to prevent unexpected incidents "starting from the backyard" is the prerequisite for career success. When husband and wife live in harmony and cooperate, they can escape poverty and become prosperous. Careers should progress from within to the outside, step by step, with persistence, leading to eventual success.		
		
Business: Apply household management methods to commercial activities. In dealing with company employees, a combination of strictness and leniency is required, with an emphasis on strictness. It is advisable to concentrate leadership under one person who manages, with collective cooperation, accumulating over time.		
		
Seeking Fame: Rely on hard work, enduring poverty happily, and more importantly, the support of family. As the family flourishes, personal success in career endeavors becomes easier.		
		
Marriage: A harmonious family is the foundation of everything, and the wife is the root of the family. Choosing a wife should be done with caution to bring harmony and prosperity to the family.		
		
Decision Making: Success comes smoothly due to the support of a good family and wife, and it is essential to maintain this advantage. Otherwise, prosperity can quickly turn into decline. It is especially important to guard against family upheaval. Managing the household relies on treating others with humility and frugality, accumulating wealth. Family members should be harmonious and friendly with one another.
- Scholar Interpretation: When the heart is directed inward, the household prospers; being strict and consistent cannot sway the heart. Those who receive this hexagram will find it advantageous to collaborate with others, and there are many signs of joyful events. Families in harmony can work together with a united heart to develop their endeavors. 		
		
Famed Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is at its peak, but be cautious with words and actions.		
Wealth: Accumulate goods, as they will later be sold at high prices.		
Home: Be wary of fires; strengthen family ties.		
Health: Excessive phlegm and asthma are difficult to cure.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Providing Nourishment

### General Information

- Description: Yi Hexagram: Divination yields auspicious omens. The study of nurturing lies in self-sufficiency.		
		
The "Xiangs" commentary states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen representing mountain, and the lower trigram is Zhen representing thunder. Thunder emerges from within the mountain, all things begin to sprout; this is the image of the Yi Hexagram. Observing this image, the noble person contemplates the difficulties of nurturing and growth, thus becoming cautious with their speech to avoid misfortune. They exercise moderation in diet and cultivate their character.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by stacking different trigrams, with Zhen below and Gen above. Zhen represents thunder, and Gen represents mountain. The mountain is above while thunder is below, resulting in an exterior that is solid and an interior that is empty. Spring warmth nurtures all things, fostering the virtuous and educating the people according to the season. Yang is substantial, while Yin is insubstantial; the substantial nourishes people, and the insubstantial is nourished by people. One must rely on their own efforts.

Business: Avoid rushing for success, be cautious and thorough, proceed gradually, treat others sincerely, cooperate with others genuinely, adapt to circumstances, and continuously seek new directions for expansion. It might be appropriate to take some risks when necessary.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Aiming to enrich one's knowledge, one should be content and joyful, work hard diligently, and have a great likelihood of success.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Avoid rushing into success; the key lies in strengthening self-cultivation. Once you have chosen, pursue with full effort, and especially do not be indecisive.		
		
Decision Making: Pay attention to moral cultivation, be willing to do your best to help others, assist those in urgent need, and do not seek undeserved wealth. Therefore, one can gain respect from others and continue to receive external assistance, making personal endeavors very smooth and increasing the likelihood of success.

**Here's my question: The emotional direction of Parents**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
**Hexagram Analysis:**

You are asking about the emotional direction of your parents. The primary hexagram for your reading is "Providing Nourishment," which in general symbolizes sustenance and self-sufficiency. The upper trigram is Gen, meaning mountain, and the lower trigram is Zhen, meaning thunder. The central focus of the hexagram is self-cultivation and cautious action, as emphasized in both fortune and decision-making explanations. The hexagram suggests that an introspective and prudent approach is necessary for nourishing oneself and others.

- **Line 4 (Shi line)** emphasizes seeking a living without harmful intentions, highlighting watchfulness as a tiger and caution against others to live peacefully. It relates to the idea of protecting oneself and one’s livelihood.
  
- **Line 2 (Ying line)** and **Line 6** highlight consequences of envy and deviation from nurturing principles, respectively.

**Examples Analysis:**

Let's analyze step by step the interpretation described in the two examples:

**Example 1 Interpretation Analysis:**
- The example question was about resolving family conflicts.
- The hexagram was "Opposition," indicating challenges and contradictions, specifically within personal or family relationships.
- Sibling transformation suggested the resolution stems from insufficient communication.
  
Analysis Steps:
1. Identify the Significator: Sibling line (communication and relationship issues).
2. Assess the strength of the Significator: It transformed to a more harmonious state indicating potential reconciliation.
3. Examine Shi and Ying: Indicates querent's role active but with internal conflict.
4. Evaluate Hexagram Image: Opposition suggests initial struggle but possibility of resolution through better communication.

**Example 2 Interpretation Analysis:**
- The example question also focused on resolving family conflicts.
- Hexagram "The Family" suggests harmony and cooperative efforts are essential.
- The Sibling line was noted as vibrant, indicating active communication within the family.
- Shi line strong, suggesting the inquirer plays a crucial role.

Analysis Steps:
1. Identify the Significator: Sibling line (indicating communication or family roles).
2. Assess the strength: Active and vibrant, meaning strong communication is happening.
3. Examine Shi and Ying: Strong self-line suggests a vital role of the questioner in resolving issues.
4. Evaluate Hexagram Image: Indicates a broader favorable environment for resolution.

<analyze>
From both analyses, the focus on the strength and transformation of lines related to communication and familial relationships was critical. Tracking the transactional nature of the relationships within the hexagram lines (like Sibling transformation or strength) provided insight into how conflicts or issues could be addressed. The harmony or struggle of hexagram elements and trigrams provided contextual grounding to overlay these transformations.
</analyze>

**Interaction and Reasoning:**

<reason>

1. **Significator Identification:** Your inquiry relates to emotions, specifically those of parents. The Line 5, "Nine in the Fifth Place," is of Interest due to its element (Water) and relation (Parents), suggesting parental emotional states as receptive yet strong.

2. **Strength Assessment:**
   - **Elemental Interaction:** Water element of Line 5 (Parents) is strengthened by the flowing nourishment from thunder (Zhen). Positive but cautious nourishment indicates a potential external barrier toward spontaneous sharing or emotion demonstrating.
   - **Status and Clash:** Despite a 'Prime' status, it's changing to fire (conflicting element), indicating potential emotional fluctuations or stress pressures. Elemental changes may reflect a change in emotional climate—related potentially to their receptivity or external situations.
   - **Spirits Influence:** White Tiger on Line 5 can denote straightforwardness, lending forceful character but necessitating careful, gentle communication.

3. **Shi and Ying Lines:** Shi Line (Line 4 again) complements by assuaging fears—actively nurturing actions and stability within the relationship setting. Ying (Line 1) has an internal conflicting water status against Prime, suggesting baselines have outer fundamental insecurities or changes causing unease.

4. **Hexagram Imagery and Interaction:**
   - "Providing Nourishment" indicates a solid, supportive ground but suggests fickle elements affected by environments contrasting stability needed with mountain parallels but possibly a burst of potential emotional thunderstorms—occasional emotional flare-ups.

Step by step interactions speak to roots of emotional provision tied to personal procedure followed in routines ensuring emotional communication or stability without misplaced expectations, implying potential sources of emotional fulfillment or imbalance depend on their objective focus and mutual clarity.

In conclusion, from this context and utilizing the hexagram's nurturing yet sometimes-stifling image, there is an emotional cautiousness; guardedness stemming from environmental, perhaps familial, factors shaping responsive emotional drive and guidance.

</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Your parents' emotional direction, as indicated by the hexagram "Providing Nourishment," reflects a state of cautious support and self-sufficiency. They may be focused on personal and familial stability, encouraging careful introspection and prudent decision-making in their lives.

While there is a potential for emotional nourishment and stability, there may also be an underlying tension or fluctuation, indicated by the changes in elemental interactions. Their emotional landscape seems to be balanced yet may experience occasional stress or external pressures that require thoughtful management.

Overall, their direction is towards stability and nurturing through careful and deliberate actions. Encourage open communication to fully manifest the potential of a harmonious and supportive environment in the family.

Standard Answer: Parents are prosperous and favorable, so there should be no major issues at present. However, with the fifth line showing an isolated and transformed Parents leading to exhaustion, continued development in this direction would be unfavorable, and there is a possibility of separation.
