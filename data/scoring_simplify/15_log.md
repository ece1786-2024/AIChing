## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: After Completion

### General Information

- Description: Ji Ji Hexagram: Success. This is a divination that shows slight initial prosperity. Initially favorable, but eventually changes will occur. 		
		
The Xiangci (Commentary on the Symbolism) states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Kan, representing water; the lower trigram is Xun, representing fire. Water above, fire below, water douses fire, which is the imagery of the Ji Ji hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram and thus prepares during times without trouble, preventing calamity before it happens.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Kan above) stacked together. Kan represents water, and Li represents fire. Water and fire interact, with water above fire, overpowering the fire, successfully achieving the task of extinguishing it. "Ji" means "already"; "Ji" means "accomplished." Ji Ji signifies that things have already succeeded, but change is bound to occur eventually.		
		
The Great Image: Kan water is above Li fire. The nature of water is to move downward, while the fire tends to rise upward. When water and fire collaborate, it signifies completion.		
		
Fortune: A symbol of gaining both fame and profit, success is indicated. However, one must guard against the principle of extremes leading to reversal; initially prosperous but potentially leading to misfortune later.		
		
Career: Everything is smooth and prosperous, and even great achievements may have been accomplished. The key issue is how to maintain this momentum. It's essential to understand the truth that fortune peaks before decline, to anticipate and prevent future troubles, and to take measures before problems arise. Simultaneously, one must closely monitor the situation, seize favorable opportunities, continue to strive upward, and advance career development.		
		
Business: Benefitting from favorable market conditions, much profit has already been earned. However, this also signifies potential crises at any moment. Therefore, one must be careful and proactive, preventing issues before they arise, staying vigilant and cautious throughout the day. Additionally, actively observe market changes, adjust strategies accordingly, and explore new markets.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: The basic conditions for personal pursuit of fame and profit are already in place. It is crucial to prevent becoming rigid and conservative, which could lead to failure and abandonment halfway.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Initially smooth, but obstacles may arise midway.		
		
Decision-making: All conditions are excellent, and the environment is favorable for growth. However, this may lead to self-satisfaction, causing one to stop progressing or even become decadent and decline. One must continuously work hard, maintain humble virtues, keep a vigilant mindset, and prevent unexpected incidents.		
		
The Ji Ji hexagram is a hexagram of stacked opposites, with Li below and Kan above. Kan represents water and Li represents fire; when water and fire interact, water is above fire, overpowering the fire, completing the task of extinguishing it. "Ji" means "already"; "Ji" means "accomplished." Ji Ji signifies that things have already succeeded, but change is bound to occur eventually.		
		
The Ji Ji hexagram follows the Xiao Guo hexagram, as explained in the "Sequence of Hexagrams": "One who overcomes minor faults can achieve success, thus Ji Ji follows." Correcting minor errors leads to success, hence the discussion of the Ji Ji hexagram.		
		
In "The Image," this line explains: Water is above fire, Ji Ji; the gentleman uses foresight to prevent problems. It points out: The imagery of Ji Ji – Li (fire) below and Kan (water) above, with water over fire – symbolizes cooking food with fire, indicating that the food is cooked, representing the success of a matter; a gentleman should have a far-seeing perspective and, after success, consider potential drawbacks and prevent them before they occur by taking precautionary measures.		
		
Ji Ji symbolizes success, enlightening the truth that prosperity inevitably leads to decline. This hexagram is considered a moderately favorable one. "The Image" states: "Your name will be inscribed above the Golden List, not wasted was the effort of past hard work. For those who encounter this hexagram, fame and celebration are auspicious; everything aimed for will be successful and prosperous."
- Scholar Interpretation: Assistance and accomplishment, resolute and self-respecting; transitioning from large to small to ensure flourishing luck.		
		
For those who receive this hexagram, success in career is indicated, with a symbol of achievement. However, it is crucial to guard against decline after prosperity, and retreat is considered auspicious. Further advancement would be inauspicious.		
		
Fortune: Excessive prosperity will inevitably decline, be cautious of future troubles.		
		
Wealth: Acting promptly can yield profits.		
		
Home: A grand house can be inhabited; a harmonious hundred-year union.		
		
Health: Just recovering from a serious illness, still requires self-care.

The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.

Consequently, they have awe and respect, adhering solely to propriety.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (Qian below and Zhen above). Zhen signifies thunder; Qian signifies heaven. Qian is strong and Zhen moves. The sky roars with thunder, clouds roll, and the momentum is grand. Yang energy is abundant, and all things grow. The strength is robust, hence it is called powerful. Large and powerful, thus it is named Great Power. The four yang lines are vigorous, proactive, and effective. Both the upper and lower are just, with correct standards and upright shadows.

If you should keep yourself in place, do not move recklessly to avoid disaster. Do not overreach, or you will encounter danger. Be cautious of vile people and never underestimate their treachery. Courageously advance in your career, but avoid impulsiveness.		
		
Business: In a period of boom, the situation is favorable. However, do not overreach, nor act rashly. Actively enhance cooperation with others. Stay alert and understand the principle that things reverse when they reach the extreme. Prepare for a downturn in business.

Decision-making: Maintain appropriate strength and do not overly exhaust yourself. When things go smoothly in your career, particularly avoid acting rashly.

**Here's my question: How is the performance of the pawnshop business?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

**Example 1 Analysis:**

In Example 1, the question pertains to the profitability and future success of opening a shop. The primary hexagram given is "After Completion" (Ji Ji), which generally represents success that is already achieved but cautions against future decline. The interpretation focuses on several aspects:

1. **Hexagram Image and Characterization:** Ji Ji signifies completion and reminds us that change will eventually come even after success. The hexagram's image is "Water above Fire," with a hint of having achieved success but with potential risks ahead.

2. **Fortune Description:** While initially indicating fame and profit, the hexagram warns about potential misfortune if actions lead to extremes.

3. **Specific Lines Cited:** 
   - For instance, the changing Line 1 indicates that wading through and holding up one’s garment means there is no catastrophe, symbolizing a cautious beginning. This line then changes to indicate that advancement or retreat should rely on commands, which is favorable for a warrior's divination.
   - The interpretation emphasizes that there's success, but also warns against becoming complacent.

4. **Interactions and Conclusions Drawn:** The interpretation deduces the unfavorable spirit or elements like fire reflecting potential financial loss. Therefore, while the hexagram suggests success, it warns against resting too comfortably and highlights the importance of foresight to avert decline.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

For Example 2, the inquiry surrounds the suitability of transferring a shop's ownership. The primary hexagram is "Possession in Great Measure" (Great Possession), indicating prosperous and unimpeded.

1. **Hexagram Image and Fortune:** This hexagram represents great success, having overcome difficult periods. However, it also suggests exercising caution to avoid the extremes that can bring about its reversal.

2. **Line Emphasis:** The interpretation most notably leverages the Wife and Wealth line, which is reported as prosperous and active. This indicates the potential for successful transfer.

3. **Overall Hexagram Context:** The mentioning of static Self line implications suggests the need to choose a suitable buyer for optimal benefits.

4. **Conclusion:** The favorable Wife and Wealth indicates success in transfer, but emphasizing proper selection highlights the cautious aspect of ensuring future stable outcomes.

<analyze>
The analytical approach taken in these examples involves examining the fortune of the primary hexagram, the dynamics of the specific lines, and how these interact. The conclusions draw upon the prosperity and strength of significant elements and consider advised caution or actions within given contexts, like selecting an appropriate buyer.
</analyze>

Now, applying similar methods to your query about the pawnshop business using "The Power of the Great":

<reason>
1. **Hexagram Overview:** "The Power of the Great" (Da Zhuang) hexagram is observed, symbolizing strong fortune yet with the advisory to maintain calm and avoid impulsive actions or resting only on strength.

2. **Interactions within the Hexagram:**
   - The hexagram consists of thunder sounding in the sky, suggesting robust and formidable influence — Image of utmost integrity. However, as one of the six conflict hexagrams, it indicates the need for careful navigation.
   - Strength and vigor are apparent, but warnings are against extremes as these can lead to blunders, showcasing the natural retraction of Fortune at peaks.

3. **Line Focus:**
   - The Shi line, given as Line 2 which changes, signals auspicious signs but changes to represent someone eating beyond their means, suggesting caution against indulgence.
   - The Ying line (Line 5), representing Children, although prime, notes losing sheep — seen as operating within an inappropriate environment possibly leading to loss.

4. **Interpretation:** The strong nature provided suggests potential for successful operations but there is a repeated emphasis on maintaining balance and properly harnessing power. Be aware of rash risks, focus on proper strategies catered to the environment, and understand extreme actions potentially leading to business downturns.

Thus, while the current performance of the business may be strong, heed the advice to maintain equilibrium, and readjust if facing challenges, to prevent decline.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The performance of your pawnshop business, as indicated by "The Power of the Great," suggests that while it currently stands strong and robust, there is a significant emphasis on maintaining balance. The fortune of your business is at its peak, and this hexagram warns against overreaching actions or relying solely on strength.

Exercise caution, avoid impulsive moves, and be wary of acting beyond means, as these could lead to losses. Just as thunder resonates impressively in the sky, your business has loud success, but heed the warning that acting at extremes might result in a natural decline. Focus on strategic management and cautious navigation to sustain and potentially improve your business's prosperous performance.

Standard Answer: The moving line encounters a clash, and the wealth line suffers detriment, indicating an overall short-term disadvantage. It is advisable to adjust the strategy.
