## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The active element is at Shen, giving life to the self. During the Shen month, it should return, but in this hexagram, the day and month represent the original spirit, with all six lines quietly moving to give life again, transforming into a return to life. The original spirit is somewhat excessively strong; it should return when the original spirit is weak, likely during the Chou month, when the active element enters the tomb and impacts the changing line.  

        Here's the information about the hexagram(s) I got:

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (Pǐ) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.		
		
Career: The situation is adverse, the career is in a declining phase, with many difficulties. There is interference from antagonistic people leading to frustration and many setbacks. One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.		
		
Home and dwelling: be diligent and frugal to avoid disaster; there is an indication of separation. 		
		
Health: the flow of vital energy and blood is obstructed, moderation in diet is advised.

**Here's my question: A woman asked when her husband would be released from prison.**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step how the example interpretations were inferred from the hexagram information provided.

<analyze>
### Example 1:
1. **Identify the Significator(Six Relations):**  
   - In this context, the question involves "the loved one returning home," suggesting we look for a line indicating movement or change, likely associated with a family member.
   
2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator:**  
   - The Line 3 is identified as the Shi line ('world'), indicating the subject's focus. It's in a "resting" state, so looking for change or movement.
   - Line Element: ji hai water, Relation: Demons, suggests obstacles or challenges.
   
3. **Analyze Shi and Ying Lines:**  
   - Line 6 as Ying line, is in a prosperous state (ren xu soil, relation: Children). Despite daily clash, suggests movement or overcoming current circumstances.

4. **Evaluate Overall Hexagram Image:**
   - Focus on the main hexagram: "Fellowship with others." Indicating cooperative energy and potentially positive movement.

5. **Interpretation Conclusion:**  
   The conclusion indicates a potential time of return in the Shen month, based on the element of vitality and cooperative energies.

### Example 2:
1. **Identify the Significator:**  
   - Again focusing on line showing movement or connection with family.

2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator:** 
   - Line 5 as Shi line, originally in a resting state. Changed to become prosperous suggesting potential positive movement.

3. **Analyze Shi and Ying Lines:**  
   - Variations in hexagram suggest external circumstances changing, with Line 6 as Ying, offering potentially favorable shifts even amidst challenges.

4. **Evaluate Overall Hexagram Image:**
   - Indicates a transformative period where return is possible during a specific temporal phase of weakened original spirit.

5. **Interpretation Conclusion:**  
   Suggests potential return timeframe shifting depending on when circumstances align favorably during Chou month.

The methodology in these examples relies strongly on analyzing the positions and interactions between the Shi and Ying lines, supported by the relevant hexagram imagery and line elements.

### Interpretation for Hexagram of Stagnation (Pǐ) in Response to When Husband Will Be Released From Prison:

1. **Identify the Significator(Six Relations):**
   - Given the question, we're exploring release from confinement, likely linked to Line 1 (Parents) or Line 6 (Closure), seeking a movement from obstruction.
   
2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator:**
   - The Shi line in position 3 indicates wealth and obstacles, possibly hinting at impediments to freedom.
   - Line 4 faces a monthly clash and death status, signifying strong opposition or delay.
   
3. **Analyze Shi and Ying Lines:**
   - Line 3 Shi indicates potential wealth or opportunity frustrations. Challenges lie in Dead status Line 4 (obstructive energies).
   - Line 6 as Ying line indicates a confined state, blocked energy. Indicates challenges and delays before release or resolution.

4. **Evaluate Overall Hexagram Image:**
   - With "Stagnation" as primary, and its traits of non-communication between Heaven and Earth, point towards continued stagnation or delay.

5. **Interpretation Conclusion:**
   Given the strong elements of obstruction, delays in resolution are likely. Release may not be immediate or within an expected timeframe, pending elements in weakening months or clashes being resolved.

Thus, the interpretation cautiously points to ongoing challenges before a favorable resolution related to husband's release.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The interpretation of the Hexagram of Stagnation suggests delays and challenges regarding your husband's release from prison. The obstructions and energy imbalances imply that resolution may not come soon or easily. You may need to be patient and prepared for potential setbacks. Release might occur when conditions shift during more favorable times, which are not clearly imminent at present.

Standard Answer: This hexagram suggests not to rush, wait for six days, and observe for news on the bingwu day. The husband is highly likely to be released from prison within two days, or he might also be released at night.
