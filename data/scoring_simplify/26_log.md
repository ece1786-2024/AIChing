## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Possession in Great Measure

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Great Possession: Prosperous and Unimpeded.		
		
The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.		
		
Fame: Some reputation has been gained, but do not become complacent and stagnant. Avoid indulging in worldly affairs, and continue striving upward with the help of true friends to reach new heights.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: With superior conditions, many choices are available, so it is best to proceed cautiously. Efforts should be made to maintain the family for both parties.		
		
Decision-Making: With a strong personality, courageous in overcoming difficulties, striving for progress. Numerous challenges and misfortunes arise on the path forward, and only by taking them seriously can continual success be achieved. If vigilance is relaxed, arrogance and complacency will lead to disastrous failure. Many friends and extensive social interactions can greatly aid the career, though there may also be malicious individuals attempting to undermine.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun is bright in the sky, shining upon all things; it is magnificent and prosperous, maintaining abundance and stability. Those who receive this hexagram are enjoying good fortune, with everything auspicious and great harvests, but they should be wary of the principle that extremes lead to reversal, and that at the peak of prosperity, decline may follow. 		
		
Fortunes: Unparalleled smoothness and outstanding brilliance.  		
Wealth: Proceed boldly, and wealth will come naturally.  		
Family: A household that accumulates good deeds, with descendants preserving it.  		
Health: Rising false fire, be careful with treatment.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gu: Great fortune and prosperity. It is beneficial for crossing water or rivers, but one must begin the journey on a day of Xin three days before the day of Jia or on a day of Ding three days after the day of Jia.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing the wind. The virtuous person resides like a mountain at the top, spreading moral teachings below. This is described as the wind beneath the mountain, an image of the Xun hexagram. A noble person observing this hexagram takes inspiration from the wind that blows across all things, rescuing the populace and implementing moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: The hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Xun, above is Gen) stacked together and is mutually complementary with the Sui hexagram. The original meaning of Gu is matter, which extends to trouble and chaos. Vessels that remain unused for a long time breed worms, symbolizing a world that has been stable for too long and has grown stagnant and corrupt, necessitating innovation, creation, governance, rectification, crisis resolution, and revitalization of business.		
		
The Image: The wind enters beneath the mountain, closed without exit, leading to decay and breeding of worms. Enthusiasm is blocked, leading to ruin through stagnation.		
		
Fortune: Everything is unsatisfactory, difficult, and confusing. It is advisable to make bold innovations; otherwise, it will lead to domestic and foreign troubles.		
		
Career: Luck is in a poor state, either due to external conditions or personal factors. Only by careful analysis of the reasons and identifying the drawbacks, with decisive and bold action, even at the risk of adventure, can obstacles be overcome. At this time, one must keep a calm mind and consult with wise people to create achievements.		
		
Business: Many disadvantages are troubling you, and it is not advisable to continue on the old path. A comprehensive analysis of market trends is needed to make decisive changes and seek alternative routes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Many difficulties and disadvantages will be encountered, which should be viewed as tests of oneself. With exceptional courage, continue to strive, while also humbly searching for one’s shortcomings and remedying them.		
		
Marriage and Love: Unsuccessful. If both parties are in love, they should go all out to bring about this matter, with the couple working together to maintain the family.		
		
Decision-Making: Born out of time, the family's or career's decline is evident, and one is in a troublesome period. Only by facing reality, being diligent, persevering, and achieving something, even at the risk of adventure, can the declining situation be salvaged. It is also necessary to patiently wait for the right opportunity when required.
- Scholar Interpretation: Three vessels are in ruin; things fall apart. With diligence and care, transformation from danger to safety is possible. For those who receive this hexagram, it is a time of difficulty and confusion, where nothing goes as desired. It is advisable to be bold in innovation, strive for improvement, and work hard, for danger can be transformed into safety.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Peirong:		
		
Timely fortune: Strive to make progress; old perspectives can change.		
		
Wealth: Accumulation is not advisable; sell promptly.		
		
Home: Rectify family conduct; be wary of personal affairs; childbirth may be problematic.		
		
Health: Poisonous ailments; be cautious of curses.

        - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.		
		
The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.
        - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Parents

    - Spirit: Black Tortoise

    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.		
		
The "Xiang" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.
        - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth
        - Status: Prime

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
When the Parents line is prosperous and active, it indicates that the property conditions are ideal. The World line is still, reminding the seeker to seize the opportunity to avoid missing out.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Duration

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Heng: Success, absence of fault, auspicious divination. There is benefit in having a purpose.		
		
The Xiangci commentary states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Zhen, which represents thunder, and the lower trigram is Xun, which represents wind. The interaction of wind and thunder cleanses, and the universe is ever-renewed; this is the symbolism of the Heng hexagram. The junzi, observing this symbolism, stands firmly on the path of righteousness, steadfast and unwavering.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a combination of different trigrams (Xun below, Zhen above). Zhen represents the male and thunder; Xun represents the female and wind. Zhen's firmness is above, while Xun's gentleness is below. With firmness above and gentleness below, creation follows its usual course, mutually supporting growth. Yin and yang correspond, a usual state, hence it is called Heng (Perseverance).		
		
Great Image: Zhen symbolizes movement, suitable for outward development. Xun signifies entering and being inward. One inside, one outside, each occupying its position, thus achieving eternity, symbolizing the path of husband and wife.		
		
Prosperity: All matters are prosperous, continually striving yields good fortune, maintaining one's role is auspicious, acting rashly invites disaster.		
		
Career: Everything is accomplished through perseverance, and with perseverance comes success. Perseverance is the foundation of success. Therefore, the motive must be pure, remaining composed and not restless, neither rushing toward success nor rigidly adhering to a dead-end path. Start from personal realities. The greatest taboo is blind conformity, and the most favorable is adaptability. In this way, all matters will succeed smoothly.		
		
Business: Take bold actions; every venture has its advantages. Pay attention to market trends and the surrounding environment. Adapt business strategies as needed, yet do not deviate from common principles and norms. Stick to carefully chosen directions and do not follow the trends. Avoid reckless adventurism.		
		
Pursuit of Reputation: From beginning to end, start well and finish well, stand on the right path, and persistently strive. Especially in learning, improve cultivation, and success will follow.		
		
Marriage and Romance: The road to good things is often bumpy and fraught with complications. However, do not be fickle or change heart, seek harmonious coexistence, and do not stubbornly insist on your own views.		
		
Decision-making: Proceed step-by-step without expecting too much initially, yet do not abandon your pursuit because of this. Be grounded and start pragmatically, avoid being overly ambitious, do not overestimate your abilities, and avoid risky and aggressive actions. Do not be capricious. Believe in the ever-renewing universe, continuously adjust your insights, and supplement with new content.
- Scholar Interpretation: Constant and enduring, long-lasting and unchanging; the noble one benefits by not changing his principles. Those who receive this hexagram must uphold righteousness, remain steadfast, and persist with effort to achieve success. Those who lack perseverance and are inconsistent will not succeed. Fu Peirong, an esteemed scholar of traditional Chinese culture, explains:		
		
Fortune: Work hard; do not be impetuous.  		
Wealth: In trade, do not change locations.  		
Home: Do not change direction; enjoy a harmonious union.  		
Health: Shortness of breath with phlegm, persist with the old remedy.

Later, to remain cheerful as usual upon hearing the thunder indicates that one has gained some experience with such occurrences.

For men, however, events dictate propriety, and their paths are varied. If one tries to bind a man with feminine virtues, it will surely lead to danger.

**Here's my question: Can the certain investment in item be made?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step:

**Example 1: High-Risk Investments**
1. **Hexagram Identification**: The primary hexagram is "Possession in Great Measure", which is inherently prosperous and auspicious. The trigrams align as Qian (Heaven) below and Li (Fire) above.
2. **Line Assessment**: 
   - The second line, relating to Wife and Wealth, indicates the significance of investment. Being prosperous and active shows favorable conditions for wealth.
   - Changed line transformations indicate prudence and cautiousness are advisable.
3. **Shi/Ying Role**: The Self (Shi) line should be introspective and anchored, with external factors (Ying) being pragmatic. The third line, as Shi, focuses on maintaining power and involving noble actions.
4. **Interpretation and Outcome**: Prosperity is evident, but the need for caution indicates not to overextend. There is a strong recommendation for careful actions to maintain power and wealth.

**Example 2: Property Purchase**
1. **Hexagram Identification**: The primary hexagram "Work on What Has Been Spoiled" suggests difficulties and potential for revitalization.
2. **Line Assessment**: 
   - The Parent line indicates property as stable and ideal, while the inaction of the World line suggests opportunity needs seizing.
   - Changed lines indicate potential improvement with conscious efforts.
3. **Shi/Ying Role**: The Shi line indicates obstacles that need wise handling, suggesting internal reflection.
4. **Interpretation and Outcome**: Initial troubles with property conditions rectify when decisive actions are undertaken, indicating a favorable turn post-careful deliberation.

<analyze>
The primary hexagrams and their respective lines in both examples point to immediate conditions or opportunities related to the matters being questioned. The transformations advise the inquirer on action alignments—cicumspect actions in the investment scenario and practical, swift decision-making in property matters suggest feasible paths forward.

Prosperous lines or those with key relations (such as Wife and Wealth or Parent lines) highlight areas where positive interventions or prospects lie, while caution or active steps suggest how to manage risks or seize opportunities effectively through line positions and elemental clashes. These steps relay the methodology for assessing the dynamics, yielding interpretations pertinent to investment viability in similar queries.
</analyze>

Now applying the process to your inquiry about investing in an item:

<reason>
1. **Hexagram Identification**: The primary hexagram is "Duration," suggesting a need for consistent, long-term engagement without abrupt changes, with Zhen (Thunder) and Xun (Wind) interacting synergistically.
2. **Line Assessment**: 
   - The lines related to Wife and Wealth (first and sixth lines) are active, although exhibiting transitions. The changing line commentary implies circumstantial caution, with personal introspection advised.
   - The Shi Line (third) and transformations suggest a nuanced environment requiring careful perseverance and virtue retention; factors indicate initial difficulty but eventual redeeming outcomes.
   - The Ying Line (sixth) advises against abrupt ventures without deliberation.

3. **Interpretation and Outcome**: The hexagram presents a setting conducive for sustained pursuits, with dexterous navigation of circumstances. However, uneven progress implies risks should be managed through firm perseverance and tempered ambition.

Thus, the advisability of the investment leans towards a cautious, steady approach, likely fruitful through disciplined, thoughtful engagements respecting enduring norms and conditions.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Your investment in the item can proceed, but with caution. The hexagram "Duration" suggests that while there is potential for success, consistency and a long-term commitment are necessary. Avoid hastiness and ensure that your actions are deliberate and aligned with enduring strategies. The path is favorable if approached with perseverance and careful planning, implying that this investment should be a well-considered, gradual process rather than a quick one.

TERMINATE
Standard Answer: The line representing the self moves and transforms into wealth, is regenerated and combined. The wealth is nourished by the day, making it possible to seek profit, but it is empty, indicating that immediate benefits are not seen. The hexagram changes to the six clashes, which indicates it will not be permanent. Overall, it appears beneficial, but the benefit is not great.
