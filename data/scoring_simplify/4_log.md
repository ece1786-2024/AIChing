## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Progress

### General Information

- Description: Jin Hexagram: The Marquis of Kang used the fine horses granted by King Cheng for breeding, performing matings multiple times a day. The Commentary on the Image says: "The upper trigram of this hexagram is Li, which represents the sun; the lower trigram is Kun, which represents the earth. The sun shines upon the earth, and all things bathe in its splendor," this is the image of the Jin Hexagram. The superior person observes this image of the hexagram and thus enhances and magnifies their own bright virtue.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of two different trigrams stacked: Kun below and Li above. Li represents the sun and brightness, while Kun symbolizes the earth. The sun hangs high, illuminating the earth. The earth is humble and obedient, enabling all things to grow, implying brilliance, and gentle advances symbolizing a prospering enterprise.		
		
Image: The sun rises above the earth, illuminating it entirely, suggesting progress towards brightness.		
		
Prospects: Career, reputation, and financial luck are all favorable, indicating signs of gaining positions and promotions.		
		
Career: Smooth progress. One should adhere to the right path, face challenges head-on, overcome obstacles, and be guided by the situation. Establish good interpersonal relationships and gain deep trust from people. Strive wholeheartedly without any hesitation or indecision, and avoid being overly cautious, instead persist without discouragement, urging ahead courageously. Pay attention to cooperation and advance together.		
		
Business: The market is favorable, with smooth competition, but some difficulties will also arise. Face challenges head-on, be guided by the situation, overcome obstacles, and strive for public support. Setbacks during progress are inevitable, but with pure motives, crises can be turned into safety.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Through hard work and struggle, one has laid the foundation for developing a career but may not succeed immediately due to a lack of referrals. Do not become disheartened; patiently wait for an opportunity while proactively creating favorable conditions.		
		
Marriage and Love: Auspicious stars shine. The result will be ideal, but one should not adopt a nonchalant attitude or be overly picky due to perceived superior conditions.		
		
Decision-making: In a continuously rising scenario, there will not be significant resistance. However, it is essential to win trust and hearts of the people, striving even more diligently. As long as motives are pure and one overcomes complacency, happiness will surely befall.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun rises above the earth, all things progress; rewards are abundant, and all plans achieve success. 		
		
Those who obtain this hexagram are like the rising sun in the east, with strong fortune, substantial income, successful plans, and all matters go smoothly.		
		
Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets:		
		
Fortune: Good luck approaches, and progress is made step by step.		
		
Wealth: Bright profession, most profitable.		
		
Home: A house full of sunshine.		
		
Health: Self-awareness is key.

The Commentary on the Image says: The reason the gathered multitude first cries and then laughs (as the tide of battle turns from defeat to victory) is because this line is encountered in divination, with the nine in the fifth place occupying the central position of the upper trigram. This resembles one who adheres to the path of rectitude and correctness, thus necessarily turning misfortune into fortune. The joining of the large forces signifies that our army has overwhelmed the enemy.

        - Status: Confined

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Demons line is flourishing and active, generating the self line, indicating that leaders have recognition for the inquirer. The Wife and Wealth line is static and transforms into advancement, showing there is hope for promotion, but patience is required.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (Pǐ) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.		
		
Career: The situation is adverse, the career is in a declining phase, with many difficulties. There is interference from antagonistic people leading to frustration and many setbacks. One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.		
		
Home and dwelling: be diligent and frugal to avoid disaster; there is an indication of separation.

**Here's my question: After going to work, is it possible to get a salary raise?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
**Hexagram Analysis:**

1. **Overall Symbolism:**
   - The primary hexagram here is "Stagnation" (Pi), which typically signifies separation and obstruction, often brought about by petty individuals causing difficulties. This hexagram suggests a transition from prosperity to decline and notes a lack of communication between Heaven (yang energy rising) and Earth (yin energy descending), resulting in a standstill.
   - The hexagram suggests an environment where there is discord between opposing forces, and hence, nothing proceeds smoothly. It advises patience, suggesting that an imbalanced situation will eventually turn towards prosperity if virtue is nurtured during obstruction.
   
2. **Line Interpretations:**
   - **Line 1**: Indicates pulling out the roots of difficulties and making progressive moves, seen as auspicious.
   - **Line 2 and Line 3**: Both relate to internal resources, symbolizing abundance that benefits common people but indicates struggle for the nobility, suggesting a disparity in favorable outcomes.
   - **Line 3 (Self Line)**: Shows self-confinement, implying the subject's talents and virtues do not currently match their position, resonating with self-doubt.
   - **Line 4 and Line 5**: Both focus on vigilance and merit-based rewards, with a cautious approach being advised.
   - **Line 6**: Signifies short-lived misfortune turning into good fortune, suggesting a coming change in the fate's direction.
   
3. **Overall Implication:**
   - The hexagram "Stagnation" paired with the changing line transformations reflects a period marked by struggle and obstruction. Roughly interpreted, it implies that while initial resistance and hindrance are prevalent, patience and maintaining principled actions amidst adversity ultimately lead to overcoming this stagnation.

Let's analyze step by step:

**Example 1: "Is it suitable to change jobs?"** 

1. **Significator**: 
   - The focus is on the Demons line, which is strong and challenging the Self Line, indicating pressure and limited growth in current circumstances.
   - The interpretation suggests a transformation towards a more prosperous line of Wife and Wealth, reflecting better prospects in a new job.
   
2. **Interaction Analysis**:
   - The strength of the Demons line against the Self suggests high pressure and limited development in the existing job. However, Wife and Wealth transforming indicates potential for a more advantageous opportunity upon changing jobs.
   
3. **Outcome**:
   - The conclusion is based on the Demons line's activity indicating struggle against the Self and encouragement towards advancement as represented by the Wife and Wealth line's transformation.
  
**Example 2: "Can I successfully strive for a promotion opportunity?"**

1. **Significator**:
   - Focus on the Demons line flourishing and actively influencing Self Line, with a strong indication of recognition from leaders.
   - The stable Wife and Wealth Line, transitioning to advancement, suggests a hopeful outlook concerning promotion.
   
2. **Interaction Analysis**:
   - Interaction between the Demons line and Self shows support and recognition from one's superiors.
   - Wife and Wealth line's static position but transformative outcome indicates necessity for patience yet assuring prospects.
   
3. **Outcome**:
   - The interpretation heavily weighs on the transformation of the hexagram lines indicating acknowledgment from authorities and eventual progress upon careful and patient pursuit.

<analyze>
These examples use meticulously chosen Significator lines, focusing heavily on the interactions and transformations related to key Six Relations like Demons (for workplace conflicts) and Wife and Wealth (for opportunities and growth). The interpretation in each case effectively draws from the current circumstances indicated by the primary hexagram and pays attention to the transformative dynamics between lines for conclusive insights.
</analyze>

**Interaction and Reasoning:**

1. **Significator (Self Line)**: 
   - The self line in your question related to salary increase can be mapped to Line 3, associated with Wife and Wealth, indicating a confinement status reflecting stagnation in financial progression at present. 

2. **Shi and Ying Lines Interaction**:
   - The Self (Shi) and the Ying denote internal and external struggles; in this hexagram, mostly focused on personal restrictions rather than active external conflicts (considering the imbalance between Heaven and Earth), implying internal limitations in obtaining remuneration increase due to underutilization or mismatch of talents to position.

3. **Hexagram Overall Dynamics**:
   - The primary hexagram speaks to a situation where energies are obstructed—Yang ascending and Yin descending—which necessitates patience and resilience to endure short-term standstill before eventual prosperity.

4. **Transformative Lines**:
   - The lines transforming to themes of balancing caution with confidence (Lines 4-6) highlights a cautious approach amid the current financial stagnation, implying greater rewards may unfold once obstruction clears.

5. **Final Consideration**:
   - Focus on either waiting patiently for internal provisions to align with external possibilities or seeking strategies that allow harnessing personal capabilities to their fullest to tackle stagnation, aligning with overarching hexagram symbolism.

<reason>
Given the present energy represented by the Stagnation hexagram, expect an absence of immediate improvements or salary rises, necessitating patience and focus on cultivating personal capacities and virtues during this obstructive phase. Aligning internal actions with opportunities may eventually bring about progression beyond what current stationary conditions suggest.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
**Answer to Your Question:**

Given the primary hexagram "Stagnation" (Pi) and the significant influence of internal constraints, the chance of receiving a salary raise currently is unlikely. This hexagram reflects a period of obstruction and standstill in financial affairs. Internal talents and virtues might not be fully recognized or utilized in your current position. Thus, patience is advised while waiting for these circumstances to shift. Focus on aligning your capabilities with external opportunities to improve your situation in time.

Standard Answer: Recent improvements are limited, and it is advisable to wait for a good opportunity. Additionally, this hexagram suggests the corresponding lines of the yin and yang and compatibility between mao and xu, indicating benefits in collaborating with others. There may be someone who can help facilitate your development through cooperation. The Parents line is at the yin position, symbolizing others, while the yang represents yourself. The harmony between the two signifies that your collaborator may be an elder or superior, someone beneficial to you. This person could be considered a benefactor; you should definitely accept their cooperation and maintain a good relationship with them. This could lead to positive developments for your future. Overall, this adjustment is promising, moving in a favorable direction, and you should proceed as it might benefit you. Although the favorable results might not be immediately visible, when the water phase becomes prominent, the benefits may become apparent.
