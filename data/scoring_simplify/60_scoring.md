**Detailed Explanation:**

- **Purchase a house this year (3 points):**
  - The generated answer mentions purchasing a house this year and being generally favorable, which aligns with the standard answer's suggestion. However, it doesn't emphasize the certainty found in the standard answer, focusing more on caution. Therefore, I grant it 2 points for touching this element but not fully aligning with the standard answer's confidence.

- **Property options and prices favorable (3 points):**
  - The generated answer suggests abundance and success, indicating favorable property options and prosperity. However, the cautionary note about overconfidence and potential obstacles doesn't align fully with the assurance of favorable prices and options in the standard answer. Thus, I provide 2 points.

- **Advisable action (2 points):**
  - The generated answer conveys a generally favorable condition for purchasing a house, advising vigilance and prudent financial management. Although it captures the essence of being advisable, it incorporates elements of caution and possible setbacks, thus scoring 1 point.

- **Relevance (2 points):**
  - The generated answer is relevant to the question, focusing on purchasing a house this year and providing a thorough analysis aligned with fortune telling. Therefore, it scores the full 2 points for relevance.
