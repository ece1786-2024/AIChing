1. **Promise fulfillment after delay**: This is the core message of the standard answer and should be considered the most important key point, as it directly addresses the expectation of promise fulfillment, albeit delayed. Given its significance, this point should be assigned a score of 4.

2. **Clear communication and accountability**: While not explicitly stated in the standard answer, fostering communication and accountability indirectly aligns with the idea of eventually fulfilling a promise. This could be assigned a score of 2 to reflect its supportive nature in ensuring promises are kept.

3. **Pay attention to dynamics and motivations**: This aspect emphasizes understanding underlying factors in relationships. Though somewhat related, it is more about personal development and awareness, less directly connected to the promise than the other points. Therefore, it will be assigned a score of 2.
