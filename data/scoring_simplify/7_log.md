## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Conflict

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Lawsuit: Although there is potential profit to be gained (such as capturing prisoners), one must remain vigilant and cautious. Affairs initially appear auspicious, but later on become perilous. If this line is drawn in divination, it is favorable for meeting with nobles and princes, but unfavorable for crossing waters or rivers.		
		
The "Image" commentary says: The upper trigram is Qian, which represents Heaven; the lower trigram is Kan, which represents Water. With Heaven and Water isolated and their flows opposing each other, the logic and circumstances are contradictoryâ€”this is the image of the Lawsuit Hexagram. A wise person observes this hexagram to understand the importance of avoiding litigation and thus must exercise extreme caution at the beginning of any undertaking.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (with Kan below and Qian above) stacked together. It is the opposite of the Xu hexagram and serves as its "complementary hexagram." Qian signifies firmness and vigor, while Kan represents danger and entrapment. Firmness against danger, vigor against threat, naturally leads to disputes. Disputes are not favorable matters, and one must be cautious and fearful.		
		
Great Image: With Qian (Heaven) rising above, and Kan (Water) descending below, they go their separate ways, leading to litigation.		
		
Fortune: Things go contrary to one's wishes, and nothing proceeds smoothly. Villains may cause harm, so it is advisable to be wary of traps.		
		
Career: Initially smooth and profitable but then encountering setbacks. Caution is essential, along with being extremely careful and not stubbornly sticking to one's opinions. It is wise to avoid getting involved in litigations and disputes. Instead, one should retreat and make concessions to resolve conflicts, adhere to proper principles to avoid unforeseen disasters. Even if victory is achieved in litigation, ultimately there will be loss, making it not worthwhile.		
		
Business: Harmony brings wealth, and taking small losses can be a blessing. One must not pursue ill-gotten gains. Business negotiations should adhere to principles of justice, fairness, and mutual benefit, avoiding conflicts as much as possible. This approach will lead to good outcomes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Unfavorable. One still lacks competitive strength and should maintain integrity, exercise patience and self-encouragement, and must not act recklessly. With the support of influential people, one can overcome difficulties early.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Although not entirely satisfactory, it is still well-matched, and mutual understanding is achievable. Both parties should handle life gently.		
		
Decision-Making: Competitive and unwilling to accept the status quo, striving to change one's fate and surpass others. Possessing intelligence and quick reactions, with the help of patrons. However, lacking perseverance, one might easily exhibit sharpness, offending others and inviting litigation. It is advisable to acknowledge reality, go with the flow, be content, and maintain moderation. Learning from experiences and using them as cautionary lessons can lead to success and repute.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sky is high and the water is deep, reaching far without being close; be prudent in planning and retreat to defend, respect and fear will prevent misfortune.		
		
For those who receive this hexagram, both body and mind are unsettled, many matters are unfavorable, and there are many disputes with others. It is advisable to cultivate oneself and remain cautious in handling affairs.		
		
Fortune: Obstacles to fame and reputation, it is not suitable to make enemies.		
		
Wealth: Start with caution, eventually can profit.		
		
Home: A gentleman must seek a virtuous lady.		
		
Health: Prevention is better than cure.

The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the lower trigram is Gen, which represents a mountain, and the upper trigram is Dui, which represents a marsh. When there is a marsh within a mountain, the air of the mountain and the water cease, mutually responding to each other; this forms the image of the hexagram Xian. A noble person observes this image and follows the example of the deep and profound valleys, and vast and expansive marshes, thereby becoming open-minded, and with an attitude of humility, accepts others' teachings and guidance.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams stacked (below is Gen, above is Dui). Gen is the mountain; Dui is the lake. Dui is flexible on top, Gen is firm below, the water seeps downward, the flexible rises above and the firm is below, responding to each other. Response leads to achievement.

For those who receive this hexagram, it is advisable to be humble and treat others appropriately, which will lead to good fortune and favorable outcomes, with endeavors likely to succeed. However, one should not be thrown into confusion by improper affections.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Coming to Meet

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gou: A dream of a woman being injured. When encountering this hexagram through divination, it is unfavorable for marrying a woman.		
		
The Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven; the lower trigram is Xun, which represents Wind. Thus, it signifies wind under Heaven, which is the image of the Gou hexagram. Observing this image, the ruler is inspired to emulate the wind's way of touching all things gently, spreading teachings and enlightenment across the world, and proclaiming it to the four corners.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by stacking two different trigrams (below Xun, above Qian). Qian represents heaven, and Xun represents wind. There is wind under heaven, blowing across the earth, where Yin and Yang combine, making all things flourish. The GÃ²u hexagram is the opposite of the GuÃ i hexagram, constituting what is called a "complementary hexagram." GÃ²u signifies encounter, where Yin meets Yang. However, with five Yangs and one Yin, they cannot coexist for long.		
		
The Great Image: Wind penetrates everywhere, and everything it blows upon is exposed, meaning chance encounters.		
		
Fortunes: The Yin rises and the Yang declines; be wary of romantic entanglements. Obstacles are prevalent, requiring cautious action.		
		
Career: Proceed according to timing and sequence. However, potential crises lurk, with a lack of harmony between Yin and Yang. It is essential to rely on the strength of others, maintain various connections, enhance one's influence, prevent petty people from taking advantage, and strive for a change in situation. It is advisable to prepare early for all matters, wait for the opportunity, and act immediately once it is ready.		
		
Business: The market is shifting from prosperity to danger; it is wise to withdraw early. Forceful expansion is risky. No upright individuals are helping, while schemers lurk in the shadows. Thus, it is critical to maintain a clear mind, seek reliable partners, and endure while waiting for the right moment for commercial activities to redevelop.		
		
Fame: A character that does not easily integrate with others and an overly high opinion of oneself can naturally result in distress and unmet aspirations. One should rely on sincere and upright individuals and achieve success under their support.		
		
Marriage: Thoroughly examine the moral qualities of your partner and avoid becoming ensnared in a "triangle" dispute. Spouses should treat each other with sincerity to turn crises into safety.		
		
Decision-making: Favorable. One can develop smoothly in advantageous environments, but must avoid reckless actions to prevent counterproductive results. Furthermore, consistently guard against the entrapment of petty people nearby. Therefore, one should curb evil before it gains momentum, and it is better to remain isolated than to associate with unscrupulous people.
- Scholar Interpretation: Yin waxes while yang wanes, and great fortune declines; many obstacles present themselves, and one must proceed with caution. Those who receive this hexagram find that yin prospers while yang weakens, leading to numerous unfavorable circumstances. It is advised to act cautiously and to be especially mindful of romantic entanglements.		
		
According to the Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
Fortune: It is the time of good luck, with fame spreading across the world.		
Wealth: Travelers afar can profit.		
Household: Be cautious of strong winds; marriage is proper.		
Health: Beware of strokes.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: At the initial stage, a fine, soft thread is attached to a yellow brass brake. This is an auspicious omen for constancy. However, if one inquires about going somewhere, danger is inevitable, like a frail pig unwillingly dragged back. The commentary says: The fine, soft thread attached to the yellow brass brake signifies that something soft is restrained by something hard, symbolizing the weak depending on the strong, thus achieving auspiciousness.
    - Element: xin chou soil, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Clash: Daily Clash, Status: Prosperous

- Line 2
    - Description: There are fish in the kitchen. Obtaining this line through divination, there are no calamities, but it is not favorable to host banquets for guests. The Commentary on the Symbol says: There are fish in the kitchen. Having fish but no meat symbolizes modest prosperity, and it is not appropriate to lavishly entertain guests.

        - Description: Six in the third place: Depending on the inheritance from ancestors for living. Divination indicates a dangerous sign, but ultimately it is auspicious. However, if one serves in governmental affairs seeking wealth and rank, it will not be successful. The commentary states: Depending on the inheritance from ancestors for living, because the image of the third line suggests that under the position of the fourth nine, one obtains auspiciousness only by relying on ancestral influence.
        - Element: wu wu fire, Relation: Demons
        - Status: Dead

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth position: There is no fish in the kitchen. If one encounters this line through divination, any action taken will inevitably lead to misfortune.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The line "no fish in the kitchen" indicates that the person will inevitably encounter misfortune. This is because the yang line at the fourth position occupies a yin place, resembling a ruler losing his authority and becoming estranged from the people.
    - Element: ren wu fire, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake
    - Clash: , Status: Dead

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the Fifth Position: A gourd grows intertwined with a mulberry tree, with its hidden patterns appearing very beautiful. Suddenly, a gourd falls from above the head.

    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn's edge, is not a good omen, but there is no great calamity.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Encountering a wild beast, placed under its horn's edge, is because the top nine yang line is positioned at the end of the hexagram, resembling a person in a situation of adversity.

**Here's my question: A woman consulted about a lawsuit.**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step:

**Example 1: "Will the younger brother win the lawsuit?"**

- **Hexagram Information: Conflict**

  - This hexagram suggests mixed fortunes, with auspicious beginnings leading to perilous ends. It warns against litigation and advises caution. The querentâ€™s situation might start favorable but later encounters difficulties.

- **Line Analysis:**

  - The self line is static, while Demons line is active and prevails over the self line, indicating difficulties in controlling the situation. Lines primarily suggest retreat or comply rather than engaging in prolonged disputes.

**Example 2: "Can the business dispute be resolved smoothly?"**

- **Hexagram Information: Influence**

  - This hexagram indicates that smooth progress and auspicious outcomes are possible, emphasizing harmony and cooperation.

- **Line Analysis:**

  - The self line here transforms, bringing auspiciousness, indicating cooperation is key. The active Demons line suggests the potential for resolution, provided there's timely mediation.

<analyze>
In both examples, interpreting the hexagrams involves identifying the dynamic interactions within the hexagram, particularly focusing on the specific roles of active or transformed lines and especially looking at conflicting elements or line status (prosperous or dead). Both rely on assessing how the self line and other influential lines (such as Demons or Shi/Ying lines) interact with each other.
</analyze>

**Now, let's interpret your hexagram:**

**Question: A woman consulted about a lawsuit.**

**Primary Hexagram: Coming to Meet**

- **General Analysis:**

  - This hexagram involves a woman being injured, cautioning against marriage or involvements. It's about Yin meeting Yang, signifying imbalance or improper connections leading to conflict.

**Line Analysis:**

- **Line 3 (Sibling); changed line:**

  - Initially, this line suggests facing difficulties and lacks support. The transformed line suggests reliance on past foundations or support, yet possible constant danger.

- **Key Lines (Status and Interaction):**

  - The self line and Shi/Ying lines both describe elements of modest prosperity but warns against overextension. With the potential Demons element involved, it might complicate matters, suggesting internal conflicts within the involved conditions.

**Interaction and Reasoning:**

<reason>
The hexagram "Coming to Meet" depicts the interaction of elements in potentially challenging circumstances, such as a lawsuit. The transformed lines underline the significant internal shifts indicating fluctuating influences (such as inherited elements and reliance on others). The overall interpretation suggests caution is essential against overreliance on potentially unstable alliances or decisions, as unfavorable conditions can arise. Moreover, the presence of an active Demons line, with opposing favorable self and Shi/Ying lines, indicates internal confrontations may result in unpredictable outcomes, advising potential retreat or bindings on immediate disputes.
</reason>

By analyzing the hexagram this way, we see complexities in potential outcomes, yet also emphasizing precautions that reflect the balance (or imbalance) within personal or external factors involved.
Rational_Agent: 
The woman's involvement in the lawsuit is challenging. The hexagram "Coming to Meet" highlights the risks of improper connections or imbalances that lead to conflict. The transformed lines suggest trouble maintaining support, implying that despite reliance on past resources, danger remains. It advises caution and suggests that withdrawing from confrontational interactions or overextending commitments would be wise under current conditions. This lawsuit might not resolve favorably without careful management and consideration of alliances and motivations. Proceed with care and restraint.
User: 
TERMINATE
Standard Answer: The current situation of this lawsuit is not favorable, and psychological preparation is needed. It is recommended to collect more evidence and strengthen the defense. At the same time, stay calm and do not escalate conflicts. If the line representing Demons is in a state of rest and decline in the future, mediation can be attempted.
