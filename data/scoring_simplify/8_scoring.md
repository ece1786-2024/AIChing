**Detailed Explanation of Scores:**

1. **The matter may eventually succeed (1.5/1.5):** 
   - Both the standard and generated answers emphasize eventual success, aligning with the prediction that perseverance might lead to success. The generated answer mentions perseverance can eventually lead to success, earning a full score here.

2. **Current resistance is significant (1/1):**
   - The generated answer discusses the initial challenges and obstacles, reflecting the significant resistance mentioned in the standard answer. This point is well-covered.

3. **Requiring flexible responses (1/0.5):**
   - Flexibility is implied by the notion of “careful planning” and strategic approach in the generated answer, though not as explicitly as in the standard answer. Partial credit is given for this alignment.

4. **Prepare documentation in advance (1/0):**
   - The generated response does not specifically mention documentation, which is a critical part of preparation as indicated in the standard answer, leading to no score here.

5. **Communicate with relevant departments (1/0):**
   - The generated answer suggests seeking advice, but doesn't directly cover the communication with relevant departments. No score is given as the nuance of departmental communication is absent.

6. **Submit the application at a favorable opportunity (1.5/1):**
   - The generated answer speaks to timing indirectly through the strategic approach and patience, but lacks the specific actionable advice about application submission. It's related enough to earn partial points.

7. **Relevance (2/2):** 
   - The generated response is quite relevant to the situation of meeting and overcoming business challenges, offering an analysis that aligns well with the broader themes of the standard answer, meriting full relevance points.
