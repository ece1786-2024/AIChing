1. **The Demons are excessively strong (3 points)**: In the standard answer, the strength of the demons is a significant indicator of the obstacles to reconciliation. This implies that external factors or negative influences are preventing the two individuals from coming together. The generated answer does not mention any strong external obstacles, hence it receives a score of 0 for this key point.

2. **Sole entry into the tomb (3 points)**: The idea of a "sole entry into the tomb" metaphorically points to the limited possibilities or singular path available for addressing the situation. It suggests confinement and limitation. The generated answer does not address any constraints or limitation in paths or opportunities; it actually suggests multiple proactive steps, so it receives a score of 0.

3. **Possibility of reconciliation is very small (2 points)**: The standard answer clearly communicates that the chance of reconciliation is slim, thus setting a realistic or pessimistic outlook. The generated answer contrasts this by encouraging communication and expressing a hopeful path to reconciliation, which is contrary to the key point presented in the standard answer. Therefore, the score is 0.

4. **Relevance (2 points)**: The generated answer is related to the question as it provides guidance on how to approach reconciliation with the boyfriend. It suggests a method of communication and offers advice based on hexagram interpretation, which is in line with the theme of the inquiry. Hence, it receives a full relevance score of 2.
