## Primary Hexagram: The Arousing (Shock)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Zhen: During a sacrificial ceremony, the sound of thunder comes, causing some people to tremble all over, only able to resume their composure and engage in normal conversation after a moment. The sudden peal of thunder resounds over a hundred miles, yet some remain composed, holding a wine ladle without spilling a single drop. The "Commentary on the Image" states: In this hexagram, both the upper and lower trigrams are Zhen, representing thunder. Thus, the repeated strikes of great thunder signify the image of Hexagram Zhen. A gentleman observes this hexagram to cultivate caution and fear, thus reflecting and correcting his conduct.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by doubling the Zhen trigram (thunder below and thunder above). Zhen represents thunder, and when doubled, it creates a massive reverberation, which can dispel gloomy atmosphere and lead to smooth and successful outcomes. In daily life, one should remain vigilant even in safe situations, harboring a sense of fear, and avoiding complacency. When unexpected events arise, one can remain calm and composed, engaging in conversation as usual.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Contemplation

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Guan: During sacrificial rituals, wine is poured to invite spirits without offering human sacrifices, because the heads of captives used for sacrifice are swollen and cannot be used as offerings. The Xiangci states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Xun, which represents wind, and the lower trigram is Kun, which represents earth. The wind moves across the earth, blowing over all things; this is the image of Guan. The ancient kings observed this hexagram image and took the wind that circulates in all directions as a model, thereby patrolling the states, observing the people's conditions, and promoting enlightenment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacking, with wind moving on the earth, symbolizing the widespread teaching of virtue. The Observing and the Approaching hexagrams form complementary pairs for mutual use. Those in higher status contemplate the world with morality and justice, while those below look up with reverence, leading to submission of hearts.		
		
The Image: The wind moves above the earth, implying a meaning of traveling and sightseeing. Yin prevails as Yang diminishes, the righteous path weakens, and all things struggle to proceed.		
		
Fortune: Being in the midst of change, it is advisable to observe meticulously, as one may experience distress both mentally and physically, and must guard against external temptations.		
		
Career: Signs of adversity have appeared in one's career, necessitating humility and caution. One should have foresight and avoid short-term actions, remain open-minded, and focus on good interpersonal relationships, uniting with others, and not acting rashly. When necessary, it is not inappropriate to seek assistance from virtuous individuals to seek further development.		
		
Business: The market situation is unstable and in a state of flux, requiring caution and careful observation of trends, planning for the long term, and being prepared for retreat if needed.		
		
Reputation: It is important to have self-knowledge, modestly seek guidance from others, correct one's attitude towards life, and avoid self-satisfaction. Moreover, one must adhere to integrity and establish grand ideals without losing personal goals or deviating from the righteous path.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Unfavorable; both parties should withstand tests, plan for the long term, leading to an ideal outcome.		
		
Decision-making: Possessing organizational ability makes one suitable for responsible work, but life's journey involves many twists. It is crucial to cultivate foresight and observance, handling matters impartially and realistically, paying attention to human dynamics, and caring for others. Especially avoid falling into the paths of petty people or shortsighted behaviors. One should exhibit a resolute spirit, not follow blindly, and if necessary, employ strategic dependency.
- Scholar Interpretation: Observing below while viewing above, traveling and inspecting; maintaining calmness and composure, remain steadfast at your post. One who receives this hexagram finds themselves amidst change, with unsettled mind and spirit. It is advisable to observe keenly, act when the opportunity arises, and refrain from rash advancement. Fu Peirong, a renowned scholar in Taiwanese Sinology, interprets as follows: Fortune: Travel outside; it is not easy to stay idle at home. Wealth: Selling foreign goods, be cautious of risks. Residence: Worship gods and Buddhas. Health: Rheumatic conditions, exercise and nurture.

**Here's my question: Will friends fulfill their promises?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

<analyze>
### Example 1 Analysis

**1. Significator (Six Relations):** The Sibling line being prosperous and active, and clashing with the Wealth line, signals potential disagreements in the cooperation between friends. Here, the fact that the Sibling clashes with Wealth suggests conflict over resources.

**2. Strength of the Significator:** The Sibling line is active, suggesting strong influence in the situation. Given the clash with the Wealth line, it's likely a disagreement over financial matters or asset division.

**3. Shi and Ying Lines:** The self-line supported by the Wealth line shows the querent's hope of continuation and benefiting from the partnership.

**4. Overall Hexagram Image:** The primary hexagram, The Arousing (Shock), depicts an outwardly prosperous situation but warns of instability and the need for vigilance. Despite appearances, there could be hidden difficulties within the collaboration.

### Example 2 Analysis

**1. Significator (Six Relations):** The Wife and Wealth line being static implies a slow process in friends repaying the loan, hinting that the commitment is there but may not be quick.

**2. Strength of the Significator:** The Wealth line is static but interested in repayment. While not declining, its lack of activity signals it's not a top priority.

**3. Shi and Ying Lines:** The self-lineâ€™s prosperity suggests that the querent must drive communication to facilitate repayment, indicating that engagement is needed to hasten action.

**4. Overall Hexagram Image:** The Primary Hexagram, Approach, usually denotes prosperity and smooth dealings; however, prudence is necessary as rushing may lead to missed opportunities. In repayment, being proactive in seeking accountability is crucial for successful completion.

</analyze>

Now, let's proceed to interpret the current hexagram based on what we've learned:

<reason>

### Current Hexagram Analysis for "Will friends fulfill their promises?"

**1. Significator (Six Relations):** Since the question concerns promises among friends, we focus on the Sibling relation. The Significator here may be connected to the Sibling line, prevalent in both the fifth and third lines in status, implying interactions and relationships with friends impact the outcome.

**2. Strength of the Significator:** 
- **Line 5:** The Sibling line, being prosperous here after transformation, shows a positive resolution is possible if attention is given to personal relationships and shared intentions.
- **Line 3:** Observations of the group's actions, connected to the Wife and Wealth line as inactive; hence, there's a financial or commitment aspect to consider.
- **Line 6:** Further reflects a Wife and Wealth relationship, implying material security or fulfillment influences perception or decision.

**3. Shi and Ying Lines:** The Shi line being confined shows current limitations or absence of dynamic interaction â€“ slow progress, perhaps in the promise's fulfillment. Ying lines, show an essential factor in output, requiring the one asking to push for results.

**4. Overall Hexagram Image:** The Primary Hexagram, Contemplation, suggests a need for careful observation of relationships. Studying otherâ€™s actions and intentions meticulously will lead to understandingâ€”again, urging reflection and monitoring rather than direct engagement.

Combining all elements, the outcome implies fulfillment of promises has potential but requires active engagement, especially in understanding each party's sentiment and situation. Material motivations are highlighted as factors to monitor.

</reason>

However, achieving this will require you to be actively engaged in understanding their intentions and working to ensure clear communication and accountability. Pay close attention to the dynamics and motivations driving your relationships with them. Though there may be delays, maintaining vigilance and fostering positive interactions will facilitate the fulfillment of their promises.
