1. Difficulty and Challenging Path (4 points): The standard answer emphasizes the difficulty and struggles in pursuing further studies, comparing it to a difficult battle. This point is very important as it sets the tone for what one should expect on this journey.

2. Effort and Struggle Required (3 points): The standard answer outlines that only with great effort and struggle can one hope to reach the top in academic pursuits. This highlights the need for perseverance and dedication.

3. Blocked and Long Path (1 point): The idea that the academic path is blocked and long is also a key point, although less emphasized than the previous two. It provides context for why effort and struggle are necessary.

Now, let's evaluate the generated answer:

- Relevance (2 points): The generated answer is indeed related to the question of academic advancement. It discusses challenges and ways to overcome them.

- Difficulty and Challenging Path: The generated answer acknowledges challenges but does not compare the difficulty to a dispersed army or battle, which is a key metaphor in the standard answer. Score: 2/4.
  
- Effort and Struggle Required: The response suggests strategies for success, including staying committed and disciplined, which aligns with the effort required. However, it does not emphasize struggle as strongly as the standard answer. Score: 2/3.
  
- Blocked and Long Path: While the generated answer acknowledges initial difficulties, it does not explicitly mention the notion of a "blocked and long path". Score: 0/1.

Overall, the generated answer is relevant and captures important insights but misses the full depth of the challenge as portrayed in the standard answer. Hereâ€™s the table for the evaluation:
