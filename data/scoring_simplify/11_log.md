## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Taming Power of the Small

### General Information

- Description: Lesser Restraint Hexagram: Auspicious. In the western outskirts, dense clouds gather, yet the rain does not fall.		
		
The Explanation of the Image states: The upper trigram is Xun, which signifies wind; the lower trigram is Qian, which signifies heaven. With gentle winds brushing the earth, the vegetation bows and sways, flourishing vigorously—this is the image of Lesser Restraint. A noble person observes this hexagram and takes inspiration from the gentle wind that speeds the growth of all things, encouraging self-improvement and spreading moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a doubled hexagram (with Qian below and Xun above); Qian represents Heaven, and Xun represents Wind. It symbolizes a harmonious climate, favorable for the growth of crops, hence the name "Minor Restraint." The strength is limited and requires development to a certain degree before significant achievements can be made.		
		
Great Image: The capacity for nurturing is limited, and efforts feel constrained. It is advisable to endure, cultivate strength, and quietly await the right opportunity.		
		
Fortune: The situation is fluctuating, with disputes and arguments, yet difficult to resolve in the short term. Patience and waiting for the right time are necessary.		
		
Career: The timing is not yet ripe. One should patiently and actively accumulate strength, and avoid taking risky actions. If setbacks occur, do not be disheartened. Gather the courage to overcome difficulties, uphold principles, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and make preparations in advance for success.		
		
Business: There is already a certain foundation, but there is a risk of loss, thus extreme caution is required. Strive for sincere cooperation with others to achieve mutual benefits, avoid greed, maintain moderation, and avoid complacency while seeking improvement.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Set ambitious goals and strive to achieve them with maximum effort. Be open to learning from others to gain sincere support and realize one’s ideals. Be wary of sabotage by petty people.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Both parties must be extremely loyal, as there is a significant possibility of a third party intervening.		
		
Decision-Making: Progress is not very smooth, and unexpected difficulties may arise along the way. However, one's strong character and determination to overcome adverse conditions can facilitate the realization of one's ideals. It is highly possible to suffer harm from petty people. It is essential to receive sincere assistance from like-minded individuals to remove obstacles. Be content with what is gained, maintain moderation, and avoid excessive pursuit to prevent negative consequences.
- Scholar Interpretation: Strength is meager, hindering advancement; store up capabilities, await the right time, and advance patiently.  		
For those who receive this hexagram, strength is weak, and fortune is fluctuating. It is best to accumulate strength and quietly await the right moment. Rushing could be dangerous, so be patient in all endeavors.  		
Luck: Average, nothing remarkable, influenced by others.  		
Wealth: Appears good on the surface, but there are hidden losses.  		
Home: Moderately well-off, be wary of conflicts; marry a virtuous woman.  		
Health: Illnesses related to wind and fire; good for children, bad for adults.

- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of two identical trigrams (water below, water above) overlapping. Marsh or lake signifies water. When two bodies of water connect, their flows intermingle harmoniously, fostering unity, mutual assistance among friends, and joyous happiness. The trigram Dui represents joy. It embodies the virtue of firm strength within, expressed in an outward appearance of gentleness and harmony. Steadfastly adhering to the path of righteousness, it guides the people towards elevation.

Always maintain a humble demeanor and avoid overconfidence, or one may easily become surrounded by malevolent individuals.

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Da Zhuang: A favorable divination.  		
The Xiang commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Zhen, which represents thunder, and the lower trigram is Qian, which represents heaven.

Consequently, they have awe and respect, adhering solely to propriety.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (Qian below and Zhen above). Zhen signifies thunder; Qian signifies heaven. Qian is strong and Zhen moves. The sky roars with thunder, clouds roll, and the momentum is grand. Yang energy is abundant, and all things grow. The strength is robust, hence it is called powerful.

If you should keep yourself in place, do not move recklessly to avoid disaster. Do not overreach, or you will encounter danger. Be cautious of vile people and never underestimate their treachery. Courageously advance in your career, but avoid impulsiveness.		
		
Business: In a period of boom, the situation is favorable. However, do not overreach, nor act rashly. Actively enhance cooperation with others. Stay alert and understand the principle that things reverse when they reach the extreme. Prepare for a downturn in business.		
		
Fame: Be sure to wisely harness your power and do not rely on your strength to advance rashly, especially not with arrogance. Properly utilize your talents, along with external assistance, to surely achieve something.

Let's now interpret your hexagram related to your son's illness improvement:

**Your Question: When will the illness of my son improve?**

### Step-by-Step Interpretation:

#### 1. **Identify the Significator (Six Relations)**
- The inquiry pertains to the health of your son, and thus the "Children" line is the significator.

#### 2. **Assess the Strength of the Significator**
- Locate the presence of the Children line in the hexagram.
  - Line 5: "Children" line, with "Status: Prosperous" but affected by "Daily Clash."

#### 3. **Hexagram Transformation (Changed Lines)**
- The hexagram, "The Power of the Great," features strong 'Yang' attributes; however, the sixth area's change could suggest resolutions after obstacles.
- The Children line is strong within its position but affected negatively by the current day's clash; its clash indicates temporary challenges.

#### 4. **Shi (世爻, Shìyáo) and Ying (应爻, Yìngyáo) Line Analysis**
- The Shi line (children line under clash) reveals challenges but sustains its support during resolution within the encountered challenges.

#### 5. **Evaluate Hexagram and Line Dynamics**
- The overall influence from the hexagram asserts a strong assertion coupled with a requirement for patience and careful navigation of present limitations.

**Conclusion:** 
The presence of clashes indicates current temporary difficulties. Despite these clashes, the surrounding or supporting factors and lines provide a prosperous capability or core suggesting improvement may come with careful maneuvering. The overall hexagram reminds to maintain balance and refrain from pushing beyond limits. Therefore, an emphasis on patience and systematic steps towards recovery, possibly indicating the Son's health will not immediately improve but soon after the diminishment of the current obstacles.

<reason>
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Your son's illness, according to the reading, is currently facing temporary challenges due to the clash affecting his line. However, the core strength within the hexagram suggests that this situation is not permanent. Improvement is likely once these temporary obstacles have passed. A careful and patient approach will help navigate this period. Given the dynamics, improvement might be expected steadily after overcoming immediate hurdles, likely within the next month as the influence shifts and clashes resolve.
User: 
TERMINATE
Standard Answer: Demons represented by gold hold the ruling line, indicating that excessive fire suppresses, causing the ruling line to lie dormant and wait for use. The interpretation concludes that around the day of jiawu, the son's illness will improve.
