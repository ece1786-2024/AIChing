        Hello, masters. I came here to ask for my fortune.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Gathering Together

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Cui: Prosperity. The king arrives at the ancestral temple to conduct sacrifices. Receiving this hexagram through divination is beneficial for meeting noblemen and dukes; it signifies openness and smoothness. This is an auspicious and favorable omen. Offering oxen for sacrifice is also very auspicious, and traveling is favorable.		
		
The Image Commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Dui, which symbolizes marsh; the lower trigram is Kun, which symbolizes earth. Marsh water flooding the land is the image of the Cui hexagram. The junzi, observing this hexagram image, takes heed of rampant floodwaters and the gathering of troubles, thereby maintaining and preparing arms, staying vigilant against unexpected disturbances.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacked (with Earth below and Lake above). Earth signifies ground and compliance; Lake signifies marsh and water. As the marsh overflows and inundates the earth, competition among people becomes frequent, posing pervasive threats. It is crucial to follow the divine order and employ virtuous people, preparing in advance, being gentle yet cheerful, mutually enhancing each other for harmonious living and stability. Cui symbolizes gathering and unity.		
		
Image: With the marsh on the earth, water accumulates in the soil, nourishing plants, leading to luxuriant growth.		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is abundant, and with the support of elders, one can achieve great career success, but financial disputes must be cautiously avoided.		
		
Career: Flourishing and thriving, with harmony and unity. Although progressing well, excessive water symbolizes fierce competition among people. As prosperity inevitably declines, it is wise to avoid arrogance, maintain diligence and caution. However, indecision is not advisable; one should forge ahead boldly, exploring new ventures. It is essential to command respect through noble virtues.		
		
Business: Sincere cooperation and mutual assistance. Encouragement is the hallmark of thriving business. Boldly explore the market, advance prudently, and be well-prepared to ensure continual development.		
		
Seeking Reputation: Solely relying on personal effort yields limited achievements; assistance from others is necessary, combined with personal attributes, to reach the desired goal.
- Scholar Interpretation: Abundance in resources leads to great gathering and prosperity; gaining the assistance of noble guides, nothing will go amiss. For those who receive this hexagram, fortune is highly favorable. They can receive help from influential people, gain significant profits, and nothing will be disadvantageous. 		
		
Analysis by the Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Pei-Rong:		
Fortune: Stay cautious even in safety, and you can remain free from worries.		
Wealth: The image of accumulating wealth suggests cycles of gathering and dispersing.		
Home: Guard against water entering the house; maintain self-discipline and integrity.		
Health: Swelling in the chest and abdomen, take early measures to adjust.

    - Description: Six in the second place: Obtaining this line indicates long-term good fortune without misfortune. Divining about sacrificial rites, the omen shows that for the spring sacrifice, it is favorable to use prisoners as offerings. 		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: "Long-term good fortune without misfortune," because the yielding line in the second position of the lower hexagram symbolizes a person who firmly upholds the correct path and never changes.

    - Clash: , Status: Prime
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the second place: Intoxicated and not yet awake, barbarians clothed in red attack, misfortune arrives suddenly. It is advisable to urgently sacrifice to the spirits for protection. As for divining about going forth on a campaign, there is danger. In other matters, there is no great calamity.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Intoxicated and not yet awake, as Heaven grants the robes of dukes and ministers, because the line of nine in the second place resides in the central position of the lower trigram, this is an omen of upcoming celebration.
        - Element: wu chen soil, Relation: Parents
        - Status: Prosperous

- Line 3
    - Description: Line three: Worry and lament. Obtaining this line in divination is of no benefit. There are no disasters in travel, but there are minor troubles.

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.		
		
The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.

The Commentary on the Image says: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results merely in the absence of disaster because one's talents are low and cannot achieve anything substantial.
    - Element: ding you gold, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Clash: , Status: Resting

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.		
		
The "Xiang" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.
    - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - Clash: , Status: Prosperous

## Hexagram Interpretation

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Splitting Apart

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Bo: It is unfavorable to undertake anything.		
		
The "Xiangci" (Commentary on the Image) says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The mountain rests on the earth, and wind and rain erode it; this is the image of the Bo hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, taking the warning from the falling of mountain rocks and the crumbling of cliff edges, thereby strengthening the unity and loyalty of the people, enabling them to live and work in peace and contentment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of dissimilar trigrams (with Earth below and Mountain above). Five yin lines are below, with one yang line above, representing an abundance of yin and a solitary yang; a high mountain rests on the earth. Both signify the concept of peeling away, hence it is known as the "Hexagram of Splitting Apart." In this hexagram, yin flourishes while yang declines, metaphorically indicating a time when petty people gain influence and virtuous people are in distress, leading to the ruin of enterprises.		
		
Great Image: The mountain resting upon the earth symbolizes mountains and stones collapsing to the ground, with five yin lines pressuring one yang, causing justice to be damaged.		
		
Fortunes: Misfortune surrounds you, suggesting the need to reorganize. Avoid being overconfident to prevent being implicated by women and petty individuals.		
		
Career: The times are unfavorable and driven by great trends, meaning an individual can only adapt to situations and pause actions, observing changes without taking risks. It is essential to actively create conditions, build strength, and remain cautious and patient, avoiding collaboration with petty people. The turning of fortunes will inevitably lead to accomplishing goals in the near future.		
		
Business: Having transitioned from a peak to a downturn entering a period of recession, it is essential to earnestly summarize experiences and lessons, implementing reorganizations, especially avoiding rash decisions. When favorable conditions arise, exploit them to smoothly and confidently reemerge.		
		
Seeking Recognition: The likelihood of success is low, so persistent pursuit is inadvisable. Instead, continue to create opportunities, strive to improve oneself, and enhance social skills, strengthening capabilities to seize the chance for a comeback.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Considerations must be thorough; unless a match is exceedingly suitable, do not proceed carelessly. Both parties should maintain family harmony.		
		
Decision-Making: Life is fraught with twists, often leading to unfavorable or even dire circumstances. Yet, there is a chance for revival from dire situations. By calmly analyzing situations and struggling tenaciously, one will certainly transform their fate, achieving admirable outcomes that evoke envy in others. The key is to avoid hastily seeking success, and particularly avoiding taking risks. Adapt to the trends and guard against sabotage by petty individuals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Exploitation and decay, the worry of disaster; advancement is difficult to achieve, stop in accordance with the times. For those who receive this hexagram, the time and fortune are not favorable, leading to many losses and obstacles to progress. It is advisable to stop in accordance with the times and maintain one’s duty. Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan: Fortune: The time and fortune are not favorable; maintain peace of mind and your place. Wealth: Profit from exports, exploiting others' wealth. Home: Do not leave your own home; buying a temporary residence is possible. Health: The soul is not attached, be extremely careful.

The broken hut of the petty person that fails to shield against wind and rain signifies ultimately being unable to maintain peace and safety.

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Significator hidden in the Self line indicates that the item may be concealed in a familiar place. The Wealth line transforming to retreat suggests that retrieving the watch may require patience.

**Here's my question: Is it possible to find a friend with whom contact has been lost?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

### Example 1 Analysis

**Question**: Is the missing friend safe and sound? 
- **Hexagram**: Gathering Together
- **Interpretation**: Focus on the static Parents line as the useful deity, representing the friend who is perhaps resting or busy. The subject line receiving support from the day implies news will arrive later.

**Explanation of Interpretation**:
1. Hexagram: Gathering Together is associated with prosperity and has an auspicious general interpretation, suggesting favorable outcomes and unity.
2. Lines: The Parents line, representing stability and care, is chosen as the significator, remains static, a metaphor for the friend’s safety.
3. Strength Analysis: Supported by prosperity and the day, indicating reassurance the friend is safe and some news will come later.

### Example 2 Analysis

**Question**: Is it possible to find the lost watch?
- **Hexagram**: Splitting Apart
- **Interpretation**: The hidden Significator in the Self line suggests the item may be in a familiar place, and the transformation indicates a wait or patience is needed to retrieve it.

**Explanation of Interpretation**:
1. Hexagram: Splitting Apart traditionally signals unfavorable conditions, indicating challenges, yet patience might overcome these.
2. Lines: The Wealth line, related to the object, is in retreat, hinting at requiring patience to reclaim the lost item.
3. Strength Analysis: The changes and transformation align with the required patience per the interpretation, suggesting perseverance would yield results.

<analyze>
The interpretations in both examples reveal a focus on two factors: understanding the general omen of the hexagram as a backdrop to find specific elements in the lines that relate directly to the question at hand, then applying those to the situation.

The choice of certain lines as significators of the question, as well as the emphasis on static versus dynamic lines, clearly influences the interpretative direction. In Example 1, reliance on static lines indicated stability, while in Example 2, a dynamic transform suggested a process of delay that demands patience.

Furthermore, supportive or contrasting energies from the auxiliary elements like daily clashes or spirits involved add depth to forecasts, contributing to the reasoning of outcomes.
</analyze>

**Response to User's Question: Is it possible to find a friend with whom contact has been lost?**

<reason>
1. **Hexagram**: Gathering Together, traditionally denotes prosperity, unity, and harmonious conditions, so indications lean towards favorable outcomes concerning the question.
   
2. **Lines Considered**:
   - **Parents (Line 1)**: Naturally relates to nurturing, suggesting positive ties or reachability to the friend; it started changed and ended confined, possibly indicating a pause or hindrance.
   - **Prosperous Lines (Lines 6, 4)**: The spirits and status surrounding these lines, especially their emphasis on calm and supportive energies, might hint at eventual restoration of contact, despite current disconnection or challenges symbolized by confined states.

3. **Hexagram Support & Challenges**:
   - With no intrinsic conflicts (no prominent clashes at critical positions), the favorable perspective dominates.
   - The changing lines indicate transitions from concerns towards more stable positions—symbolic of potential contact regaining footing.

In summary, assembling unity and abundance, the hexagram suggests a positive fortune regarding reconnection with your friend. Absence of prominent conflict further supports this path. However, some time and patience might be necessary as transformation implies potential delays or dependencies. The auspices, while initially muted in line dynamics, collectively favor positive outcomes.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
It is likely that you will find your lost friend and reconnect. The hexagram "Gathering Together" indicates a prosperous and unifying energy, pointing towards a favorable reunion. Although there might be some delays or pauses required due to changes in circumstances, patience and time will bring you closer to finding your friend. Stay open to opportunities for reconnection.

Standard Answer: The friend you are looking for may take the initiative to contact you through a third party and restore your relationship.
