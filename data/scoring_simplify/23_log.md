        Hello, masters. I came here to ask for my fortune.
        First, please allow me to provide you some examples.
        



# Example 1

## Question: Is it possible to reconcile with family?




# 

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Family

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Family: Inquiring about matters concerning women is auspicious.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which represents wind; the inner trigram is Li, representing fire. Internally, fire; externally, wind. Wind assists the fire's strength, and fire enhances the wind's power, complementing each other—this is the image of Family. Observing this hexagram, the noble person realizes that words must have substance to avoid emptiness, and virtues must be sustained continuously to be abundant.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Xun above) stacked. Li represents fire; Xun represents wind. Fire causes heat to rise and become wind. All things should begin with an inner foundation before extending outward. Occurrences originate internally and form externally, symbolizing the idea of governing the household first before governing the realm. When the household is righteous, the world is peaceful and happy.		
		
Great Image: The image of wind blowing on fire, enhancing the power of fire, symbolizes family members working together with a united effort to develop their enterprise.		
		
Fortune: Great peace and good fortune, cooperation with others is easily successful, and there are signs of celebration, such as having children or marriages.		
		
Career: Success depends on the condition of the household. Strictly managing the household to prevent unexpected incidents "starting from the backyard" is the prerequisite for career success. When husband and wife live in harmony and cooperate, they can escape poverty and become prosperous. Careers should progress from within to the outside, step by step, with persistence, leading to eventual success.		
		
Business: Apply household management methods to commercial activities. In dealing with company employees, a combination of strictness and leniency is required, with an emphasis on strictness. It is advisable to concentrate leadership under one person who manages, with collective cooperation, accumulating over time.		
		
Seeking Fame: Rely on hard work, enduring poverty happily, and more importantly, the support of family. As the family flourishes, personal success in career endeavors becomes easier.		
		
Marriage: A harmonious family is the foundation of everything, and the wife is the root of the family. Choosing a wife should be done with caution to bring harmony and prosperity to the family.		
		
Decision Making: Success comes smoothly due to the support of a good family and wife, and it is essential to maintain this advantage. Otherwise, prosperity can quickly turn into decline. It is especially important to guard against family upheaval. Managing the household relies on treating others with humility and frugality, accumulating wealth. Family members should be harmonious and friendly with one another.
- Scholar Interpretation: When the heart is directed inward, the household prospers; being strict and consistent cannot sway the heart. Those who receive this hexagram will find it advantageous to collaborate with others, and there are many signs of joyful events. Families in harmony can work together with a united heart to develop their endeavors. 		
		
Famed Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is at its peak, but be cautious with words and actions.		
Wealth: Accumulate goods, as they will later be sold at high prices.		
Home: Be wary of fires; strengthen family ties.		
Health: Excessive phlegm and asthma are difficult to cure.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Pushing Upward

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Ascending: Extremely prosperous, beneficial for meeting with kings and nobility, without worries. If obtaining this line in divination, it is auspicious to embark on an expedition to the south.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Earth, which represents the earth; the inner trigram is Wind, which represents wood. This suggests the image of wood growing in the earth, which is the symbol of the Ascending hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, thus adhering to virtue and righteousness, enhancing self-cultivation, starting from small beginnings, and gradually nurturing lofty character.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram represents the overlapping of different trigrams (with Xùn below and Kūn above). Kūn symbolizes Earth and obedience, while Xùn symbolizes wood and humility. The Earth nurtures and grows trees, allowing them to gradually mature and flourish, symbolizing a career that progresses step by step towards great prospects, hence the name "Ascend."		
		
Great Image: Trees continually grow upwards from the Earth, indicating a tendency to ascend.		
		
Fortunes: Success in both fame and wealth, with signs of development and prosperity; it is favorable to advance southwards.

However, you should develop gradually and avoid being reckless due to initial success. Be cautious, cultivate virtues, follow virtuous seniors, and handle your career with sincerity.

Romance: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity and gradually nurture their affection, leading to certain success.		
		
Decision-making: Wishes will come true. Be smart and flexible, with a good foundation for success. Strictly discipline yourself, remain humble and obedient, earnestly seek advice from elders, and steadily and gradually develop your career. Like the growth of trees, you will eventually become a pillar of strength. However, in the growth process, caution is necessary at every step, maintaining sincerity and integrity, and advancing boldly.
- Scholar Interpretation: Rising and advancing, smoothly pursuing one's ambitions; emerging from darkness to brightness, gradually ascending and progressing. Those who receive this hexagram will find their fortunes rising, with all matters developing positively and successfully, achieving both fame and fortune.		
		
Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
Fortunes: As spring returns to the earth, one rises higher each day.		
Wealth: Save and accumulate wealth; one can become wealthy.		
Household: Renovate the mansion; elevate the status of a concubine.		
Health: Liver fire gradually increases; take care to nourish oneself early.

**Here's my question: A woman asks if she should express to her boyfriend the desire to reconcile.**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step how the examples of Hexagram Family and the auxiliary information were interpreted:

### Example 1: "Is it possible to reconcile with family?"

**Hexagram Interpretation:**
- **Significator Identification:** In Example 1, The significator chosen seems to be the Sibling line, as we're dealing with family reconciliation which suggests an issue needing harmony and connection among siblings.
- **Line Dynamics:** The line shows as flourishing, indicating emotions among family members can gradually be repaired. The changing line usually would guide the overall narrative of how relationships can develop over time, which can be interpreted through auxiliary lines supporting the Self line.
- **Supporting Factors:** The Self line being supported by the lunar phase suggests time is needed for resolution, but reconciliation is achievable.
- **Scholarly View:** There's emphasis on harmony and virtues that are brought about by internal corrections and maintaining moral standards.

### Example 2: "Can reconciliation with relatives be achieved?"

**Hexagram Interpretation:**
- **Significator Identification:** Again, the Sibling line is crucial, relevant to communication within family or relatives.
- **Line Dynamics:** Although the Sibling line is flourishing, which typically indicates connection or interaction, the main line appears static and turning to retreat. This signifies the reconciliation may require understanding, patience, and mutual cooperation before a conclusion.
- **Supporting Factors:** The transformation into a state of retreat suggests that passive understanding will initially be needed.
- **Scholarly View:** It aligns with the traditional understanding of a nurturing and steady environment which favors careful advancement to protect against unwanted disruptions.

<analyze>
The analysis of these examples demonstrates that the Sibling line's condition, its transformation, and its interaction with supporting elements play significant roles in interpreting the potential for reconciliation. By assessing changing lines, static ones, and how they influence the significator's strength, the conclusion of reconciliation depends on factors like patience, timing, and opportunity for establishing harmony. From both examples, the primary hexagram emphasizes persistent but gradual efforts towards unity and mutual understanding, with specific reference to the family or sibling lines. The auxiliary elements like monthly or daily clashes or status reflect potential conflicts or ease peers could experience.
</analyze>

Now, let's reason through your current hexagram "Pushing Upward" and the inquiry about expressing the desire to reconcile with your boyfriend:

<reason>
### Interpretation of Hexagram Pushing Upward

**1. Significator Identification:**
- The query pertains to relationship progression, focusing on mutual ascension or development, hinting the significator could link to lines associated with mutual upbringing or wealth influence like Wife and Wealth or hidden harmony.

**2. Assess Line Dynamics and Interactions:**
- Looking at the lines, the Primary Hexagram Pushing Upward is about a progressive journey, laying strong foundational work for development, often slow but definitive. Examining line interactions for changed lines, look for those influencing peace and understanding, like 4th Line changing into a state of dishonor in hunting, possibly representing missed opportunities in expressing oneself or communication errors.
- The Shi line (2) and Ying line (5) suggest the emotional impulse and realization of fears impacting advancement in the relational expression. 

**3. Overall Hexagram Image:**
- The primary hexagram Pushing Upward indicates progress supported by endeavoring virtues, suggesting the affirmation of gentler gradual approaches to express reconciliation.
- Considering auxiliary lines, if elements of fame, virtue, or actions in alignment with structured ethics are observed (for instance, Wife and Wealth lines), then they indicate positive growth and connection which can be cultivated through step-by-step affirmations.

The analysis suggests a need for steadfast progression in expressing desires, while balancing humility and observance of the partner's current emotional state. While growth potential is high, cautious, patient, and sincere communication will align with hexagram's advice for clear advancement ambitions.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
You should express your desire to reconcile with your boyfriend. The hexagram "Pushing Upward" encourages gradual and sincere communication, highlighting that this approach can lead to positive development in your relationship. Initiate this conversation with patience and humility, focusing on nurturing your connection step by step. This way, you can align with the natural progression suggested by the hexagram, paving the way for a harmonious reconciliation.

Standard Answer: This hexagram can be viewed from two perspectives: the Demons are excessively strong, and the sole entry into the tomb is also a basis for this, so the possibility of the two people reconciling is very small.
