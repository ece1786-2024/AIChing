        Hello, masters. I came here to ask for my fortune.
        First, please allow me to provide you some examples.
        



# Example 1

## Question: The matter of divination: Marriage




# 

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Pushing Upward

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Ascending: Extremely prosperous, beneficial for meeting with kings and nobility, without worries. If obtaining this line in divination, it is auspicious to embark on an expedition to the south.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Earth, which represents the earth; the inner trigram is Wind, which represents wood. This suggests the image of wood growing in the earth, which is the symbol of the Ascending hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, thus adhering to virtue and righteousness, enhancing self-cultivation, starting from small beginnings, and gradually nurturing lofty character.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram represents the overlapping of different trigrams (with Xùn below and Kūn above). Kūn symbolizes Earth and obedience, while Xùn symbolizes wood and humility. The Earth nurtures and grows trees, allowing them to gradually mature and flourish, symbolizing a career that progresses step by step towards great prospects, hence the name "Ascend."		
		
Great Image: Trees continually grow upwards from the Earth, indicating a tendency to ascend.		
		
Fortunes: Success in both fame and wealth, with signs of development and prosperity; it is favorable to advance southwards.		
		
Career: Very smooth and continually developing, advancing in due course, gradually ascending with great prospects. However, you should develop gradually and avoid being reckless due to initial success. Be cautious, cultivate virtues, follow virtuous seniors, and handle your career with sincerity.		
		
Business: Adhere to business ethics, start small, and gradually expand through hard work and sincere competition. Being steady is important, and rashness can lead to major mistakes.		
		
Seeking Fame: Diligently study and enhance self-cultivation. With intelligence and talent, you can achieve your ambitions. If recommended by others, your prospects will be even broader. However, be mindful of moderation.		
		
Romance: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity and gradually nurture their affection, leading to certain success.		
		
Decision-making: Wishes will come true. Be smart and flexible, with a good foundation for success. Strictly discipline yourself, remain humble and obedient, earnestly seek advice from elders, and steadily and gradually develop your career. Like the growth of trees, you will eventually become a pillar of strength. However, in the growth process, caution is necessary at every step, maintaining sincerity and integrity, and advancing boldly.
- Scholar Interpretation: Rising and advancing, smoothly pursuing one's ambitions; emerging from darkness to brightness, gradually ascending and progressing. Those who receive this hexagram will find their fortunes rising, with all matters developing positively and successfully, achieving both fame and fortune.		
		
Fu Peirong's interpretation:		
Fortunes: As spring returns to the earth, one rises higher each day.		
Wealth: Save and accumulate wealth; one can become wealthy.		
Household: Renovate the mansion; elevate the status of a concubine.		
Health: Liver fire gradually increases; take care to nourish oneself early.

Mao wood clashes with You gold, restraining and depleting the ruling line, resulting in auspiciousness.

The sixth line hosts Demons with You gold with the Black Tortoise, indicating ambiguity.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Waiting (Nourishment)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Xu: Capturing prisoners. Great good fortune, auspicious divination. It is favorable to cross rivers. The "Image" says: The upper trigram of Xu is Kan, representing clouds; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Clouds gather in the sky, waiting to rain, which is the image of the Xu hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram and understands that one can feast and be at ease, waiting for the right time to act.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams, with Qian below and Kan above. The lower trigram Qian signifies strength and perseverance; the upper trigram Kan signifies danger and pitfalls. Encountering danger with firmness suggests acting with prudence and not recklessly. It is advised to observe and wait for changes; success in one's endeavors is assured.		
		
Great Image: Clouds rise in the sky but do not bring rain, suggesting not to proceed hastily, and instead wait for the right opportunity.		
		
Fortune: The wise must act according to timing; rushing brings danger.		
		
Career: The key lies in assessing the situation, patiently waiting, achieving through tranquility, and avoiding risks. Haste makes waste. One must be filled with confidence, unafraid in crisis, uphold integrity, and turn danger into safety. Even when circumstances are favorable, remain vigilant.		
		
Business: Initially, circumstances are difficult and require great patience to create conditions and opportunities. Act fairly, observe the timing, and adapt to change to fulfill one's ambitions. As success approaches, be even more cautious to avoid a last-minute failure.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: The timing is not yet ripe; patience is required. One should hold firm in their beliefs, unmoved by idle chatter, work on self-improvement, and seek reliable allies, leading to success.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Be cautious and not act impulsively; gradually nurture the relationship with sincerity and enthusiasm. Though changes may occur, a good outcome is still possible. Both parties should understand the principle of overcoming strength with gentleness.		
		
Decision Making: The future is bright, ambitions can be realized. However, this requires accumulating strength and waiting for the right moment, succeeding later rather than sooner. The individual possesses strong will and a calm mind. Obstacles and dangers will be encountered along the way, which requires great caution. Face slander calmly, remain calm in the face of disaster, and be prudent in choosing one's path. Being humble and sincere will garner assistance from others, facilitating success. When the time is right, things will surely proceed smoothly.
- Scholar Interpretation: Currently, there are numerous obstacles, and progress is impeded; great achievements will come later, and the harvest will follow. For those who receive this hexagram, the time is not yet ripe, and patience is needed; rushing ahead will lead to misfortune.		
		
Fortunes: The timing is not yet mature, patiently wait.  		
Financial prospects: Capital has not been accumulated, business cannot commence.  		
Home: Peace and safety are blessings.  		
Health: Adjust your diet, health is promising.

Hexagram_Interpreter: 
To provide an interpretation, we need to dissect the provided examples and understand how their interpretations were deduced. Let's analyze each of them step by step.

1. **Hexagram Overview**:

2. **Significator Analysis**: 
   - The role of the Wife and Wealth in line 1 shines. Lines covered with Azure Dragon are indicative of auspiciousness, but the status being "dead" could implicate weakened or absent opportunities initially. However, the transition to a secure position still signals the potential for future growth.

   - The Shi line is present in line 2 (Parents), indicating stability, while the Ying line (line 5) indicates a more gradual development. Both lines suggest patience and steady progress.

4. **Elemental Influence**:
   - The clash between Mao wood and You gold shows a restraining force, suggesting checks or obstacles. The concept of cooperation with ruling lines suggests mixed auspices - hopeful but needing adjustments.

5. **Line Dynamics**: 
   - The transformation of lines offers insight into different phases or facets of the situation, providing guidance on adaptability and strategic posture.

  
### Example 2: Luck (Hexagram: Peace)
1. **Hexagram Overview**: 
   - The hexagram "Peace" deals with harmonious environments and positive developments. The imagery suggests peace facilitating good fortune and growth.
