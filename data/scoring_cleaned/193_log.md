## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Grace

### General Information

- Description: The Pi Hexagram: Success. There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  		
  		
The "Image" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.		
		
Great Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.		
		
Fortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.		
		
Career: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.		
		
Business: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.		
		
Reputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.		
		
Decision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.
- Scholar Interpretation: Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one's capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one's capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.

### Line Information

    - Description: In the first nine, wearing flower-decorated shoes, one refrains from getting on the carriage, choosing to walk on foot.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Innocence

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Wu Wang: Favorable and unobstructed, divination reveals auspicious signs. If actions are improper, there will be misfortune and harm, and endeavors will be unfavorable. 		
		
The "Image" commentary says: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, while the lower trigram is Zhen, representing Thunder. Beneath the heavens, the spring thunder rolls, all things sprout and flourish, multiplying and reproducing â€” this is the image of Wu Wang. The ancient kings observed this hexagram, thereby inspiring themselves to strive with diligence, comply with the seasons, and nurture all things.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram involves the overlay of different trigrams: Zhen below and Qian above. Qian represents the heavens, firmness, and vigor; Zhen stands for thunder, firmness, and movement. When movement is vigorous, firm, and positive, the spirit is uplifted, leading inevitably to attainment, but only by following the path of purity and truth. Without falsehood, success will come, and blessings will follow.		
		
The Great Image: Thunder moves in the sky, and the masculine energy spreads out, symbolizing truthfulness without falseness.		
		
Fortune: In all pursuits, it is advisable to maintain integrity. Those whose actions lack proper conduct will surely invite disaster.		
		
Career: It is valuable to have self-awareness and to start from one's actual circumstances without harboring unrealistic expectations. By being grounded, diligent, and careful in one's conduct, unexpected misfortunes can be avoided. Focus on the process rather than the outcome, pursue sincerely, act when the timing is right, and success in one's career will follow.		
		
Business: Avoid forcing things that are difficult. Adhere to market rules, uphold business ethics, avoid speculative mentality, and reject the pursuit of excessive profits. Through hard work and gradual accumulation, success is assured.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With good motivations and diligent effort, discard illusions, focus on the labor rather than the harvest, and inevitably there will be gains.		
		
Marriage and Love: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity, and must not take a hasty attitude. It is also inappropriate to rush into anything; let things develop naturallyâ€”a culmination will be reached when conditions are ripe.		
		
Decision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Do not deceive, do not speak falsely, be genuine and sincere; conform to nature, and blessings and prosperity will be profound and extensive. Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home's fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family. Health: Maintain exercise, and digestion will occur naturally.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Possession in Great Measure

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Great Possession: Prosperous and Unimpeded.		
		
The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.		
		
Fame: Some reputation has been gained, but do not become complacent and stagnant. Avoid indulging in worldly affairs, and continue striving upward with the help of true friends to reach new heights.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: With superior conditions, many choices are available, so it is best to proceed cautiously. Efforts should be made to maintain the family for both parties.		
		
Decision-Making: With a strong personality, courageous in overcoming difficulties, striving for progress. Numerous challenges and misfortunes arise on the path forward, and only by taking them seriously can continual success be achieved. If vigilance is relaxed, arrogance and complacency will lead to disastrous failure. Many friends and extensive social interactions can greatly aid the career, though there may also be malicious individuals attempting to undermine.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun is bright in the sky, shining upon all things; it is magnificent and prosperous, maintaining abundance and stability. Those who receive this hexagram are enjoying good fortune, with everything auspicious and great harvests, but they should be wary of the principle that extremes lead to reversal, and that at the peak of prosperity, decline may follow. 		
		
Fortunes: Unparalleled smoothness and outstanding brilliance.  		
Wealth: Proceed boldly, and wealth will come naturally.  		
Family: A household that accumulates good deeds, with descendants preserving it.  		
Health: Rising false fire, be careful with treatment.

**Here's my question: Will this business cooperation be successful?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Certainly, let's begin with the breakdown of your hexagram information. We'll start with a detailed analysis of the hexagram you drew and then relate it to the question related to your business cooperation.

### Hexagram Analysis

1. **Hexagram Identification: Possession in Great Measure (Hexagram No. 14)**
   - **Symbols and Attributes:**
     - This hexagram is composed of Qian (Heaven) below and Li (Fire) above. The Fire over Heaven signifies illumination, clarity, and visibility that comes with a great possession. This represents immense potential and the opportunity to gain and succeed significantly in endeavors.
     - The theme is about prosperity and sheer abundance, but it emphasizes the importance of not overreaching or becoming complacent, as fortunes can reverse if taken to extremes.

2. **Element Interaction:**
   - The Five Elements (Wu Xing): With Qian symbolizing Heaven (Metal element) and Li representing Fire, Metal-ke-Fire interaction is evident. Fire tends to melt Metal, suggesting that exuberance (Fire) can sometimes be tempered by discipline and control (Metal).
   - Following the sheng (generating) and ke (overcoming) cycles, the Fire element could initially seem to be diminished by Metal, yet in context, this might suggest controlled progression and avoiding excess.

3. **Six Relatives and Their Influence:**
   - Lines indicate Children, Wealth, Parents, Siblings, etc. This suggests the involvement of various personal and business networks. For business cooperation, the Wealth lines seem pertinent.
   - Your Hexagram possesses Wealth elements, especially in lines relevant to business relationships, indicating potential prosperity.

4. **The Six Spirits:**
   - Spirits like Hook Snake, Flying Serpent, etc., metaphoric and interpretive, indicate various influences. When related to business, they often imply unexpected movements, agility, and adaptability.

### Explain Interpretation in Example:

Let's analyze step by step how examples work:

- **Example 1 Analysis:**
  - The first example uses a hexagram where the Wife and Wealth lines are strong and suggest potential in business partnerships. The self line gains assistance from the correspondence line, implying mutual benefits.
  - The change lines also alter the dynamics, adding complexity. The changed line's interpretation adds layer, such as needing consistency or strategy to avoid pitfalls.

- **Example 2 Analysis:**
  - In the second example, the active and prosperous wealth line suggests significant potential. The support from the correspondence line also indicates personal strength and a favorable outlook on advancing the business.

By analyzing these interpretations, it's evident they use hexagram structure, interactions of the Five Elements, the types of Six Relatives involved, and changes in line characteristics to deduce the potential outcome. Both examples emphasize the intrinsic qualities and the aiding or hindering effects of hexagram lines and spirits' roles.

<analyze>
- The examples consistently utilize the symbolism of hexagrams and their internal lines along with auxiliary information such as Six Relatives (indicating relationships or potential profit) and Spirits (suggesting influence or change).
- The examples adapted the narrative; the Wife and Wealth line's strength, suggested engagement method, or potential pitfalls should be emphasized in line with the analysis.
- Cross-referencing with both Primary and changed lines provides depth, acknowledging harmonies and disruptions that may occur in the course of action.
- All components interact cohesively, drawing insights on the business or cooperation status. 
</analyze>

### Interaction and Reasoning

<reason>
1. **Combined Interpretation of "Possession in Great Measure" (Hexagram 14):**
   - **Current Theme:** Prosperity and considerable opportunity, yet balance needed to maintain favorable outcomes.
   - **Business Analogy:** Current energy favors expansion and robust development, akin to the light of the Sun (li) governing over the all-encompassing domain. Ensure the pursuit of this opportunity while remaining vigilant not to be overzealous, as this could invite misfortune.
   - **Line Pertinence:** The involvement of Wife and Wealth suggests tangible benefits tied directly to material success and the business cooperation attempt.
   
2. **Consideration of Specific Lines:**
   - **Lines 3 & 5 (Parents influence and Sibling involvement):** Both suggest the importance of demonstrated sincerity and ensuring collaboration unity, akin to receiving a guiding path through adversity.
   - **Changed Line 6 (Ended in Parent Line):** Suggests that the initial excitement or exultation may come with challenges necessitating patience and creative problem-solving within the cooperation.

3. **Overall Outcome on Cooperation:**
   - The reading suggests major potential for success with appropriate action and diligence but warns of oversight and the potential shift of fortune if an extravagant course is followed without thorough grounding and collective alignment with partners.

**Conclusion:** Relate the hexagram's prosperity potential to your question regarding business cooperation. The energy appears positive, with generous light, provided vigilance against taking abundance for granted remains at the forefront of interactions.
</reason>

In summary, this hexagram and its associated meanings offer an optimistic pathway for your business cooperation with advised precautions. The richness of Fortune here indicates an abundance of opportunities aligned well with your query.
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram "Possession in Great Measure" suggests significant potential and prosperity for your business cooperation. The energy is overwhelmingly positive, indicating a favorable outcome if properly managed. However, you should remain vigilant not to overreach or become complacent. Maintain discipline and balance to avoid potential reversals of fortune. In summary, the cooperation has a strong likelihood of success, provided you navigate it with careful and measured actions.

Standard Answer: Because the demons fire of Si is an unfavorable god, cooperation is difficult to achieve and progress is slow.
