## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Gathering Together

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Cui: Prosperity. The king arrives at the ancestral temple to conduct sacrifices. Receiving this hexagram through divination is beneficial for meeting noblemen and dukes; it signifies openness and smoothness. This is an auspicious and favorable omen. Offering oxen for sacrifice is also very auspicious, and traveling is favorable.		
		
The Image Commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Dui, which symbolizes marsh; the lower trigram is Kun, which symbolizes earth. Marsh water flooding the land is the image of the Cui hexagram. The junzi, observing this hexagram image, takes heed of rampant floodwaters and the gathering of troubles, thereby maintaining and preparing arms, staying vigilant against unexpected disturbances.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacked (with Earth below and Lake above). Earth signifies ground and compliance; Lake signifies marsh and water. As the marsh overflows and inundates the earth, competition among people becomes frequent, posing pervasive threats. It is crucial to follow the divine order and employ virtuous people, preparing in advance, being gentle yet cheerful, mutually enhancing each other for harmonious living and stability. Cui symbolizes gathering and unity.		
		
Image: With the marsh on the earth, water accumulates in the soil, nourishing plants, leading to luxuriant growth.		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is abundant, and with the support of elders, one can achieve great career success, but financial disputes must be cautiously avoided.		
		
Career: Flourishing and thriving, with harmony and unity. Although progressing well, excessive water symbolizes fierce competition among people. As prosperity inevitably declines, it is wise to avoid arrogance, maintain diligence and caution. However, indecision is not advisable; one should forge ahead boldly, exploring new ventures. It is essential to command respect through noble virtues.		
		
Business: Sincere cooperation and mutual assistance. Encouragement is the hallmark of thriving business. Boldly explore the market, advance prudently, and be well-prepared to ensure continual development.		
		
Seeking Reputation: Solely relying on personal effort yields limited achievements; assistance from others is necessary, combined with personal attributes, to reach the desired goal.
- Scholar Interpretation: Abundance in resources leads to great gathering and prosperity; gaining the assistance of noble guides, nothing will go amiss. For those who receive this hexagram, fortune is highly favorable. They can receive help from influential people, gain significant profits, and nothing will be disadvantageous. 		
		
Analysis by the Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Pei-Rong:		
Fortune: Stay cautious even in safety, and you can remain free from worries.		
Wealth: The image of accumulating wealth suggests cycles of gathering and dispersing.		
Home: Guard against water entering the house; maintain self-discipline and integrity.		
Health: Swelling in the chest and abdomen, take early measures to adjust.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Initial Six: Captured prisoners, yet they escaped, causing disorder and anxiety, and people are shouting while pursuing them all around. Finally recaptured, there is joy and laughter, no need to worry anymore. Drawing this line, boldly proceed, there is no disaster.  		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Disorder and distress, his mind is confused.
    - Element: yi wei soil, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying

- Line 2
    - Description: Six in the second place: Obtaining this line indicates long-term good fortune without misfortune. Divining about sacrificial rites, the omen shows that for the spring sacrifice, it is favorable to use prisoners as offerings. 		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: "Long-term good fortune without misfortune," because the yielding line in the second position of the lower hexagram symbolizes a person who firmly upholds the correct path and never changes.
    - Element: yi si fire, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the second place: Intoxicated and not yet awake, barbarians clothed in red attack, misfortune arrives suddenly. It is advisable to urgently sacrifice to the spirits for protection. As for divining about going forth on a campaign, there is danger. In other matters, there is no great calamity.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Intoxicated and not yet awake, as Heaven grants the robes of dukes and ministers, because the line of nine in the second place resides in the central position of the lower trigram, this is an omen of upcoming celebration.
        - Element: wu chen soil, Relation: Parents

- Line 3
    - Description: Line three: Worry and lament. Obtaining this line in divination is of no benefit. There are no disasters in travel, but there are minor troubles.		
		
The commentary states: No disasters in travel, because the line three yin position is below the line four yang position, resembling a subordinate being obedient to a superior, behaving with caution.
    - Element: yi mao wood, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.		
		
The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.
    - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Children, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the fifth place: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results in no disaster. Do not lightly punish others. Inquiring about long-term fortune or misfortune, the oracle shows that there will be no great regret.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results merely in the absence of disaster because one's talents are low and cannot achieve anything substantial.
    - Element: ding you gold, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.		
		
The "Xiang" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.
    - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The useful deity Parents line is static, indicating that friends may be resting or busy. The subject line is supported by the day, suggesting that news will arrive later.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Splitting Apart

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Bo: It is unfavorable to undertake anything.		
		
The "Xiangci" (Commentary on the Image) says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Kun, representing the earth. The mountain rests on the earth, and wind and rain erode it; this is the image of the Bo hexagram. A noble person observes this hexagram image, taking the warning from the falling of mountain rocks and the crumbling of cliff edges, thereby strengthening the unity and loyalty of the people, enabling them to live and work in peace and contentment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of dissimilar trigrams (with Earth below and Mountain above). Five yin lines are below, with one yang line above, representing an abundance of yin and a solitary yang; a high mountain rests on the earth. Both signify the concept of peeling away, hence it is known as the "Hexagram of Splitting Apart." In this hexagram, yin flourishes while yang declines, metaphorically indicating a time when petty people gain influence and virtuous people are in distress, leading to the ruin of enterprises.		
		
Great Image: The mountain resting upon the earth symbolizes mountains and stones collapsing to the ground, with five yin lines pressuring one yang, causing justice to be damaged.		
		
Fortunes: Misfortune surrounds you, suggesting the need to reorganize. Avoid being overconfident to prevent being implicated by women and petty individuals.		
		
Career: The times are unfavorable and driven by great trends, meaning an individual can only adapt to situations and pause actions, observing changes without taking risks. It is essential to actively create conditions, build strength, and remain cautious and patient, avoiding collaboration with petty people. The turning of fortunes will inevitably lead to accomplishing goals in the near future.		
		
Business: Having transitioned from a peak to a downturn entering a period of recession, it is essential to earnestly summarize experiences and lessons, implementing reorganizations, especially avoiding rash decisions. When favorable conditions arise, exploit them to smoothly and confidently reemerge.		
		
Seeking Recognition: The likelihood of success is low, so persistent pursuit is inadvisable. Instead, continue to create opportunities, strive to improve oneself, and enhance social skills, strengthening capabilities to seize the chance for a comeback.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Considerations must be thorough; unless a match is exceedingly suitable, do not proceed carelessly. Both parties should maintain family harmony.		
		
Decision-Making: Life is fraught with twists, often leading to unfavorable or even dire circumstances. Yet, there is a chance for revival from dire situations. By calmly analyzing situations and struggling tenaciously, one will certainly transform their fate, achieving admirable outcomes that evoke envy in others. The key is to avoid hastily seeking success, and particularly avoiding taking risks. Adapt to the trends and guard against sabotage by petty individuals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Exploitation and decay, the worry of disaster; advancement is difficult to achieve, stop in accordance with the times. For those who receive this hexagram, the time and fortune are not favorable, leading to many losses and obstacles to progress. It is advisable to stop in accordance with the times and maintain one’s duty. Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great Confucian scholar from Taiwan: Fortune: The time and fortune are not favorable; maintain peace of mind and your place. Wealth: Profit from exports, exploiting others' wealth. Home: Do not leave your own home; buying a temporary residence is possible. Health: The soul is not attached, be extremely careful.

    - Spirit: White Tiger

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Those who work hard do not get food, while those who do not work get food; the nobleman rides in a splendid carriage, while the petty person’s thatched hut does not shield against wind and rain. The commentary says: The nobleman riding in a splendid carriage represents a heavy burden for the common people. The broken hut of the petty person that fails to shield against wind and rain signifies ultimately being unable to maintain peace and safety.
    - Element: bing yin wood, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Significator hidden in the Self line indicates that the item may be concealed in a familiar place. The Wealth line transforming to retreat suggests that retrieving the watch may require patience.

The commentary says: In a household of poverty, if one can work diligently, they maintain upright family values. In a tomb of wealth and honor, if one focuses solely on laughter and merriment, they stray from the path of diligence and frugality.

**Here's my question: Is it possible to find a friend with whom contact has been lost?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's begin by analyzing the examples step by step.

<analyze>
### Example 1 Analysis:

1. **Question:** Is the missing friend safe and sound?

2. **Hexagram Information:**
   - **Primary Hexagram: Gathering Together:** The hexagram of prosperity, unity, and gathering of resources suggests good prospects and an auspicious outcome.
   - **Lines:**
     - Line 1: Disorder and anxiety are noted, but no long-term disaster, indicating a situation of initial chaos leading to resolution.
     - Line 2: Long-term fortune with no misfortune, supporting positive outcomes over time but emphasizes a need for patience (as this line changes).
     - Line 3: Minor troubles but no disasters, advising caution in dealings.
     - Line 4: Great good fortune and absence of disaster.
     - Line 5 & 6: Indicate work to avoid regret and embody anxiety without disaster, respectively.

3. **Hexagram Interpretation:** 
   - Key Element: "Parents" line being static indicates a reserved or stolid situation (friends being busy/resting, hence no severe issues).
   - Support and Transformation: The subject line being supported by the day's element indicates that resolution or news is impending, reinforcing the primary hexagram's indication of eventual gathering or contact.
   - The interpretation derives understanding of the prognosis not just from overall auspiciousness but from specific line analysis and their elemental supports.

### Example 2 Analysis:

1. **Question:** Is it possible to find the lost watch?

2. **Hexagram Information:**
   - **Primary Hexagram: Splitting Apart:** An unfavorable time for actions, suggesting issues and challenges.
   - **Lines:**
     - Line 1: Self-destructive foundation suggests starting issues that must be addressed.
     - Line 3: Opportunity to seize without disaster when circumstances align (this line changes) suggests potential for turnaround.
     - Other lines reinforce the idea of misfortune and the necessity of cautious reevaluation.

3. **Hexagram Interpretation:** 
   - "Significator" indicates concealment nearby, subtly highlighting the potential of "hidden" meanings such as careful searching in known areas.
   - The transformation lines suggest patience and perseverance, echoing in the changing of line interactions (from Wife and Wealth as concerns to possibly Children, implying generative or youthful energy for "rediscovery").
   - Hence, interpretation is balanced between the primary hexagram's unfavorable outlook and possible, albeit challenging, resolution.

In both cases, line interpretations, along with changes and elemental relationships, are used to synthesize a holistic outlook based on the inquiry.
</analyze>

<reason>
### Interpretation of Your Question:

**Primary Hexagram: Gathering Together**

1. **Hexagram Information:**
   - This hexagram carries themes of unity and collective prosperity, indicating an eventual reconnection or "gathering" as favorable.
   - The image of water accumulating on earth suggests the nurturing of circumstances that could foster renewal of contact.

2. **Line Analysis:**
   - **Line 1 (Changed):** Begins with disorder, yet suggesting eventual resolution as the captured disorderly essence is re-harmonized—doubled by change to a guarding attitude.
   - **Line 2:** Long-term good without immediate detriment suggests maintaining clear intentions with hope of amicable outcomes with consistent communication efforts.
   - **Line 3 (Changed):** Worry but no disaster, indicating an inconvenience rather than insurmountable separation; changing implies diligence can remedy disruptions to prosperity.
   - **Line 4 (Changed):** Indicates significant good fortune through maintained harmony and family-like bonds, reinforcing the re-establishment of contact upon invested effort.
   - **Line 5 & 6:** Anxiety over contact, yet criending without grace encourages measured actions and strength of will to sustain the relationship when re-established.

3. **Hexagram Interactions:**
   - The relationship elements are notably familial: Parents and Children in relations note protective instinct and the eventual natural reconnection.
   - Spirits like the White Tiger and Flying Serpent suggest vigilance as protective, with the Hook Snake and Vermillion Bird encouraging transformative action.

In synthesis, although the inquiry stems from a lack of contact, the hexagram’s nature and detailed supportive lines posit a favorable condition for renewing communication, leveraging the cyclical "gathering and dispersing" theme of wealth and relations. Keep vigilant in your efforts, maintain openness facilitated by Earth and Lake symbols and expect anticipation of gathering when cultivations yield resultively.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Yes, it is possible to find the friend with whom contact has been lost. The hexagram "Gathering Together" suggests that there will be an opportunity for unity and reconnection. Although there may be initial disorder and anxiety, the situation will likely resolve positively over time with patience and consistent efforts. Stay open and vigilant, as nurturing circumstances can foster the renewal of contact.
