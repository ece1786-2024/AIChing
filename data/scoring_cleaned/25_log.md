## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Opposition

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Kui: When this hexagram is encountered in divination, it is auspicious for small affairs. 		
		
The Image says: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Li, which symbolizes fire, and the lower trigram is Dui, which symbolizes marsh. Fire above and marsh below, the two are separated, representing the symbolism of Hexagram Kui. The exemplary person observes this hexagram image and thus synthesizes the commonalities of all things and analyzes the differences among everything.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a combination of different trigrams (below is Dui, above is Li). Li represents fire; Dui represents a lake. With fire above and lake below, they contradict and do not support each other. Conflict leads to new creation, with no stagnation in forward and backward movements. Everything has its differences, and inevitably there exist contradictions. Kui symbolizes contradiction.		
		
Great Image: Li fire moves upward, Dui lake moves downward, one ascending and one descending, they oppose each other. Additionally, the image is of two women dwelling together, showing a lack of proper order.		
		
Fortune: The overall fortune is lacking, and it is difficult to accomplish things, reflecting the incompatibility of water and fire. It is advisable to stay calm and composed amidst changes.		
		
Career: Starting a career is difficult, and the situation is tough. However, if you can be like-minded and have mutual trust, your goals can be achieved. Initially, small successes are common, and these small achievements can accumulate into larger ones. Success comes from united effort and cooperation, but failure comes from differing wills. It is important to strengthen unity, and seek mutual understanding through compromises, avoiding internal suspicion.		
		
Business: Enter market competition with a calm and harmonious attitude, seeking commonalities while preserving differences. Do not be hostile toward competitors; maintain harmony without being excessively accommodating or partisan. Avoid causing disputes and strive to prevent disasters.		
		
Fame: Strive to advance sincerely. Even with bad people, do not avoid all interactions when necessary; adopt a forgiving and accommodating approach, and engage moderately. With like-minded individuals, complete agreement is not necessary; seek common ground amidst differences.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: Both parties must be sincere with one another. Otherwise, a third party can easily intervene, leading to suspicion between the couple and potentially the breakdown of the family.		
		
Decision-making: In a state of contradiction and opposition. It is essential to face life with tolerance, calmness, and gentleness. Only then can you maintain peace of mind and progress gently. Understand the principle that union involves separation, and separation involves union; within sameness, there are differences, and within differences, there are similarities. Otherwise, excessive rigidity leads to irritability, and excessive clarity leads to doubt. Both rage and suspicion can be fatal.
- Scholar Interpretation: When people's hearts are outwardly directed, they go against the path; it's difficult to accomplish things, not suitable for major undertakings. Those who receive this hexagram have bad luck; water and fire are incompatible, mutually contradicting, making all matters difficult to achieve.		
		
Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese National Studies:		
		
Fortune: Communication between high and low is blocked, handle it with righteousness.		
		
Wealth: What others abandon, I take; there is still a small profit.		
		
Residence: It's advisable to move away; choose carefully whom to marry.		
		
Health: Heat above and dampness below, truly difficult to treat.

### Line Information

The "Xiang Commentary" says: Seeing a slave with a branded forehead and a cut nose pulling the cart symbolizes the line image: the third six being a yin line in a yang position, which is not appropriate, like a person falling into a pitiful situation. Initially, there's misfortune, but the ending turns out well because the third six, a yin line, advances to encounter the fourth nine, a yang line, like a person receiving help from a strong individual.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Family

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Family: Inquiring about matters concerning women is auspicious.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The outer trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which represents wind; the inner trigram is Li, representing fire. Internally, fire; externally, wind. Wind assists the fire's strength, and fire enhances the wind's power, complementing each otherâ€”this is the image of Family. Observing this hexagram, the noble person realizes that words must have substance to avoid emptiness, and virtues must be sustained continuously to be abundant.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (with Li below and Xun above) stacked. Li represents fire; Xun represents wind. Fire causes heat to rise and become wind. All things should begin with an inner foundation before extending outward. Occurrences originate internally and form externally, symbolizing the idea of governing the household first before governing the realm. When the household is righteous, the world is peaceful and happy.		
		
Great Image: The image of wind blowing on fire, enhancing the power of fire, symbolizes family members working together with a united effort to develop their enterprise.		
		
Fortune: Great peace and good fortune, cooperation with others is easily successful, and there are signs of celebration, such as having children or marriages.		
		
Career: Success depends on the condition of the household. Strictly managing the household to prevent unexpected incidents "starting from the backyard" is the prerequisite for career success. When husband and wife live in harmony and cooperate, they can escape poverty and become prosperous. Careers should progress from within to the outside, step by step, with persistence, leading to eventual success.		
		
Business: Apply household management methods to commercial activities. In dealing with company employees, a combination of strictness and leniency is required, with an emphasis on strictness. It is advisable to concentrate leadership under one person who manages, with collective cooperation, accumulating over time.		
		
Seeking Fame: Rely on hard work, enduring poverty happily, and more importantly, the support of family. As the family flourishes, personal success in career endeavors becomes easier.		
		
Marriage: A harmonious family is the foundation of everything, and the wife is the root of the family. Choosing a wife should be done with caution to bring harmony and prosperity to the family.		
		
Decision Making: Success comes smoothly due to the support of a good family and wife, and it is essential to maintain this advantage. Otherwise, prosperity can quickly turn into decline. It is especially important to guard against family upheaval. Managing the household relies on treating others with humility and frugality, accumulating wealth. Family members should be harmonious and friendly with one another.
- Scholar Interpretation: When the heart is directed inward, the household prospers; being strict and consistent cannot sway the heart. Those who receive this hexagram will find it advantageous to collaborate with others, and there are many signs of joyful events. Families in harmony can work together with a united heart to develop their endeavors. 		
		
Famed Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong's interpretation:

Wealth: Accumulate goods, as they will later be sold at high prices.		
Home: Be wary of fires; strengthen family ties.

Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's begin by examining the components of your hexagram and understanding its example interpretations to guide the interpretation we will create for your question.

# Hexagram: Providing Nourishment (Yi)

At its core, the Yi hexagram is about nurturing, growth, and self-sufficiency. With the energies represented by thunder and mountain, there is a symbolism of something burgeoning from within, requiring a steady approach to cultivate and develop.

For the matter of emotional direction, this suggests a need to focus on self-development and maturity within relationships.

### Specific Elements and Six Relatives

From these examples, we see that interpreting a hexagram involves examining each component's interactionâ€”from the overall hexagram to each line's transformation and spirit. Key themes lie in the relationships interpreted from the six relatives and six spirits. Harmony is achieved through self-awareness and unity among factors contributing to the changing line's evolution, triggering favorable outcomes.
