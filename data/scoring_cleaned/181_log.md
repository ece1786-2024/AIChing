## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Well

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of the Well: To change the settlements without changing the water well is equivalent to doing nothing. People come and go by the well to draw water, and if the well becomes dry and silted without being cleaned, and instead, the water jar is broken—this is an omen of danger.		
		
The "Image" says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Xun, which symbolizes wood; the upper trigram is Kan, which symbolizes water. Water seeps downward and trees grow upward; this is the imagery of the Well hexagram. The noble person observes this image, takes inspiration from how well water nourishes people, and thus encourages the people to be diligent and to mutually encourage one another.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the stacking of different trigrams, with the lower being Xun and the upper being Kan. Kan represents water; Xun represents wood. Trees thrive and flourish when they have access to water. People rely on wells for water, and wells are created by human effort. There is mutual nourishment, as the well provides water to sustain people, and it is inexhaustible over time. People should learn from this virtue, diligently encouraging themselves in their endeavors.		
		
The Great Image: Water is absorbed by plants, nourishing the tree, symbolizing the act of drawing water from the well, which implies economy and repetition.		
		
Fortune: The well represents something static and immovable, so one should not be overly aggressive or enterprising in their actions and should avoid a lack of vigor. Handling matters calmly and steadily is more beneficial.		
		
Career: The situation is stable. One should neither advance rashly nor retreat, but should instead strive positively to learn and improve oneself, increasing personal strength and preparing for opportunities, which will lead to great achievements. The greatest fear is stagnation, as it may result in being deemed obsolete.		
		
Business: The market is favorable, and one can continue following the original strategy. Continue with a spirit of diligence and advancement, sincerely exploring the market. Pay special attention to cooperation with others, assisting each other, enriching and accumulating experiences in practical activities.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With proper intentions to contribute to society, one should study diligently. Special attention should be given to seeking guidance from virtuous and capable people, which could lead to recognition and recommendation.		
		
Marriage and Love: There is no need to rush; a suitable partner will appear in due course.		
		
Decision Making: Be intelligent, quick-witted, and willing to help others. There will also be opportunities to fully exhibit one's talents. By embracing the spirit of the "water well," sincerely dedicating oneself and continually enriching one's abilities, society will surely value this contribution.
- Scholar Interpretation: Still waters flow from the source, with a calm and steady movement; maintaining an unchanging position, preserving the status quo. Those who receive this hexagram should cultivate their character and nurture their nature, go with the flow, remain composed and serene; calmness brings benefit, while movement leads to misfortune.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's Confucian scholar Fu Peirong:		
		
Fortune: Wood and water generate each other, fame and achievement are hopeful. 		
Wealth: Profit exceeds the capital, naturally pleasing. 		
Home: Repair the house and prevent water damage; yin and yang are balanced. 		
Health: The kidneys are excessively bloated, immediate treatment is necessary.

## Question: Can the important document submission be completed on time?

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gu: Great fortune and prosperity. It is beneficial for crossing water or rivers, but one must begin the journey on a day of Xin three days before the day of Jia or on a day of Ding three days after the day of Jia.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing the wind. The virtuous person resides like a mountain at the top, spreading moral teachings below. This is described as the wind beneath the mountain, an image of the Xun hexagram. A noble person observing this hexagram takes inspiration from the wind that blows across all things, rescuing the populace and implementing moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: The hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Xun, above is Gen) stacked together and is mutually complementary with the Sui hexagram. The original meaning of Gu is matter, which extends to trouble and chaos. Vessels that remain unused for a long time breed worms, symbolizing a world that has been stable for too long and has grown stagnant and corrupt, necessitating innovation, creation, governance, rectification, crisis resolution, and revitalization of business.		
		
The Image: The wind enters beneath the mountain, closed without exit, leading to decay and breeding of worms. Enthusiasm is blocked, leading to ruin through stagnation.		
		
Fortune: Everything is unsatisfactory, difficult, and confusing. It is advisable to make bold innovations; otherwise, it will lead to domestic and foreign troubles.		
		
Career: Luck is in a poor state, either due to external conditions or personal factors. Only by careful analysis of the reasons and identifying the drawbacks, with decisive and bold action, even at the risk of adventure, can obstacles be overcome. At this time, one must keep a calm mind and consult with wise people to create achievements.		
		
Business: Many disadvantages are troubling you, and it is not advisable to continue on the old path. A comprehensive analysis of market trends is needed to make decisive changes and seek alternative routes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Many difficulties and disadvantages will be encountered, which should be viewed as tests of oneself. With exceptional courage, continue to strive, while also humbly searching for one’s shortcomings and remedying them.		
		
Marriage and Love: Unsuccessful. If both parties are in love, they should go all out to bring about this matter, with the couple working together to maintain the family.		
		
Decision-Making: Born out of time, the family's or career's decline is evident, and one is in a troublesome period. Only by facing reality, being diligent, persevering, and achieving something, even at the risk of adventure, can the declining situation be salvaged. It is also necessary to patiently wait for the right opportunity when required.
- Scholar Interpretation: Three vessels are in ruin; things fall apart. With diligence and care, transformation from danger to safety is possible. For those who receive this hexagram, it is a time of difficulty and confusion, where nothing goes as desired. It is advisable to be bold in innovation, strive for improvement, and work hard, for danger can be transformed into safety.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Peirong:		
		
Timely fortune: Strive to make progress; old perspectives can change.		
		
Wealth: Accumulation is not advisable; sell promptly.		
		
Home: Rectify family conduct; be wary of personal affairs; childbirth may be problematic.		
		
Health: Poisonous ailments; be cautious of curses.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Inner Truth

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Zhongfu: Offering pigs and fish, although the offerings are modest, the sincerity of heart is auspicious. It is beneficial for crossing rivers. This is a propitious divination.		
		
The commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Xun, representing wind; the lower trigram is Dui, representing a marsh. A marsh with wind above it causes waves to rise. This is the image of Zhongfu. The noble person, observing this image, is inspired to influence the state through moral education and places moral teaching as a priority. Therefore, they carefully deliberate in legal matters, avoiding heavy punishment lightly.		
		
Interpretation from "The Mysterious Mechanism of the Yi":		
Hexagram Zhongfu has Xun above and Dui below, which is the wandering soul hexagram of the Gen palace. Zhongfu signifies loyalty and sincerity, which is advantageous for crossing great rivers and overcoming difficulties.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below Tui, above Xun) stacked together. The original meaning of "fu" is incubation, referring to the precise timing of a chick hatching from an egg, signifying trustworthiness. The hexagram's form, solid on the outside and hollow inside, symbolizes inner sincerity, thus called the Zhong Fu Hexagram. This represents the foundation of one's conduct in life.		
		
Da Xiang: Zhong Fu represents sincerity. The wind blowing over the water in the marsh makes waves, symbolizing resonance.		
		
Fortunes: In all matters, treating people with sincerity and handling affairs with trustworthiness will lead to success in everything. However, harboring evil intentions will lead to misfortune.		
		
Career: Approaching your career with honesty and loyalty leads to significant achievements and smooth development. It's essential to continue following the principles of righteousness. Do not be careless, overly trusting, or self-enclosed due to pride, as this will lead to career failure.		
		
Business: Managing wisely in alignment with market demands, practicing caution, emphasizing trustworthiness and high-quality service, can result in satisfying outcomes. Even risks and challenges can be overcome without issues.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: On the basis of moral self-cultivation, one must diligently learn knowledge and skills, improving continuously. Meanwhile, do not fear difficulties and strive forward.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity, leading to happiness and fulfillment.

This approach can overcome any difficulty, and even if problems arise, they can be remedied. However, it is essential to enhance the ability to observe others and improve the level of discerning right from wrong.
- Scholar Interpretation: Trusting and genuine, sincere and honest; assistance from confidants, plans will succeed. Those who receive this hexagram, if they are upright and honest, will find it auspicious and will receive help from friends, and their plans will succeed; but those who harbor evil intentions will meet misfortune. 		
		
Fortune: Troubles and disputes are unavoidable, be cautious of litigation. 		
Wealth: Act with caution to avoid disaster.
