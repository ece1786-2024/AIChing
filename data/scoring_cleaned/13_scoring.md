To evaluate the quality of the generated answer compared to the standard I Ching fortune-telling answer, we first need to break down the standard answer into its key components:

1. **Seeking Wealth Involves Hardship (2 points)**: The standard answer emphasizes that seeking wealth is difficult, indicating that it takes more than just superficial efforts to achieve financial success. It suggests there will be challenges and difficulties in the pursuit of wealth.

2. **Attention to Sibling Ruling Oracle (2 points)**: The standard answer advises focusing on concepts related to sibling relationships within the oracle, which hints at cooperation, harmony, or possibly division and competition. It is key to success in mitigating potential disputes, emphasizing attentiveness to relational dynamics.

3. **Avoidance of Dispute (2 points)**: Integral to the reading, avoiding arguments or conflicts is paramount. Disputes could impede progress and must be managed carefully.

4. **Auspicious Omen (2 points)**: This indicates a positive sign or favorable outcome if the advice is followed, implying a hopeful end result after challenges are navigated.
