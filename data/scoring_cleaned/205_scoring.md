First, let's break down the standard answer into several key points:

1. **Only Colleagues Would be Transferred** - This is the core of the standard answer, emphasizing that the individual will not be transferred, but colleagues will. Assigning a score of 4 for this point due to its importance.
   
2. **Inevitability of Transfer** - The inevitability of the transfer occurring to colleagues is another important aspect. This sets the tone and certainty of the situation. Assigning a score of 2.
   
3. **Personal Exemption** - The fact that "it won't be me" signifies an essential exemption of the individual from being transferred. Assigning a score of 2.

Now, let's evaluate the generated answer:

Relevance Score: The generated answer does relate to the question because it provides insights based on a hexagram about potential challenges and outcomes that align with the context of job transfer. Hence, a score of 2 is given for relevance.

Evaluation of Key Points with Scores:

1. **Only Colleagues Would be Transferred**:
   - This key point is not clearly addressed in the generated answer. It focuses more on personal challenges and proactive behavior instead of differentiating between the individual and colleagues. 
   - Score: 0

2. **Inevitability of Transfer**:
   - There is no emphasis on the inevitability aspect of any transfer in the generated answer. The answer focuses more on possibilities and personal action rather than the certainty of a transfer occurring to others.
   - Score: 0

3. **Personal Exemption**:
   - The generated answer implies the potential for the individual to face challenges, which contradicts the notion of being exempted from transfer as mentioned in the standard answer.
   - Score: 0

Let's summarize the results in the CSV table format:
