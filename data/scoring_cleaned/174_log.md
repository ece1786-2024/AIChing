## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Duration

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Heng: Success, absence of fault, auspicious divination. There is benefit in having a purpose.		
		
The Xiangci commentary states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Zhen, which represents thunder, and the lower trigram is Xun, which represents wind. The interaction of wind and thunder cleanses, and the universe is ever-renewed; this is the symbolism of the Heng hexagram. The junzi, observing this symbolism, stands firmly on the path of righteousness, steadfast and unwavering.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a combination of different trigrams (Xun below, Zhen above). Zhen represents the male and thunder; Xun represents the female and wind. Zhen's firmness is above, while Xun's gentleness is below. With firmness above and gentleness below, creation follows its usual course, mutually supporting growth. Yin and yang correspond, a usual state, hence it is called Heng (Perseverance).		
		
Great Image: Zhen symbolizes movement, suitable for outward development. Xun signifies entering and being inward. One inside, one outside, each occupying its position, thus achieving eternity, symbolizing the path of husband and wife.		
		
Prosperity: All matters are prosperous, continually striving yields good fortune, maintaining one's role is auspicious, acting rashly invites disaster.		
		
Career: Everything is accomplished through perseverance, and with perseverance comes success. Perseverance is the foundation of success. Therefore, the motive must be pure, remaining composed and not restless, neither rushing toward success nor rigidly adhering to a dead-end path. Start from personal realities. The greatest taboo is blind conformity, and the most favorable is adaptability. In this way, all matters will succeed smoothly.		
		
Business: Take bold actions; every venture has its advantages. Pay attention to market trends and the surrounding environment. Adapt business strategies as needed, yet do not deviate from common principles and norms. Stick to carefully chosen directions and do not follow the trends. Avoid reckless adventurism.		
		
Pursuit of Reputation: From beginning to end, start well and finish well, stand on the right path, and persistently strive. Especially in learning, improve cultivation, and success will follow.		
		
Marriage and Romance: The road to good things is often bumpy and fraught with complications. However, do not be fickle or change heart, seek harmonious coexistence, and do not stubbornly insist on your own views.		
		
Decision-making: Proceed step-by-step without expecting too much initially, yet do not abandon your pursuit because of this. Be grounded and start pragmatically, avoid being overly ambitious, do not overestimate your abilities, and avoid risky and aggressive actions. Do not be capricious. Believe in the ever-renewing universe, continuously adjust your insights, and supplement with new content.
- Scholar Interpretation: Constant and enduring, long-lasting and unchanging; the noble one benefits by not changing his principles. Those who receive this hexagram must uphold righteousness, remain steadfast, and persist with effort to achieve success. Those who lack perseverance and are inconsistent will not succeed. Fu Peirong, an esteemed scholar of traditional Chinese culture, explains:		
		
Fortune: Work hard; do not be impetuous.  		
Wealth: In trade, do not change locations.  		
Home: Do not change direction; enjoy a harmonious union.  		
Health: Shortness of breath with phlegm, persist with the old remedy.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Continuous digging, without ceasing, leads to divination of peril, offering no benefit. The peril of continuous digging arises because seeking depth recklessly inevitably leads to the disaster of collapse.

The commentary says: Governing the people with a policy of suppression is akin to the situation where the line three yin line improperly occupies a yang position; such a ruler is not a competent monarch. If there is anxiety and regret, the disaster can be averted.

- Line 4

    - Description: Nine in the fifth position: Consistent conduct. Divination brings good fortune to women, while it is dangerous for men.   		
The "Image" commentary says: The line statement indicates that women maintain chastity and virtue, which is auspicious. This aligns with the principle of a wife following her husband throughout life. For men, however, events dictate propriety, and their paths are varied. If one tries to bind a man with feminine virtues, it will surely lead to danger.
    - Element: geng shen gold, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise

- Line 6

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Grace

### General Information

- Description: The Pi Hexagram: Success. There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  		
  		
The "Image" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.		
		
Great Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.		
		
Fortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.		
		
Career: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.		
		
Business: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.		
		
Reputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.		
		
Decision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.
- Scholar Interpretation: Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one's capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one's capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Retreat

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Dun: Successful. A divination of minor gain is beneficial.		
		
The "Image Text" states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, and the lower trigram is Gen, representing Mountain. Under Heaven, there is a mountain; Heaven is high and the mountain is distant, embodying the image of the Dun hexagram. By observing this hexagram, the noble person avoids confronting the petty with evil for evil, instead adopting a strict stance, hanging up his official cap and tablet, willingly retreating into seclusion, and distancing himself from petty individuals.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is made of different trigrams (below Gen and above Qian) stacked together. Qian signifies Heaven, and Gen signifies Mountain. Under the heavens stands a mountain, with the mountain high and the heavens retreating. Yin grows while Yang diminishes, resulting in petty individuals gaining power, and the noble retreating, preserving their wisdom and awaiting the chance to save the world.		
		
Great Image: The mountain is beneath the heavens, where Yin gradually grows, and Yang gradually diminishes. It is advisable to retreat a prudent distance.		
		
Fortune: The path of the petty flourishes, while the path of the noble wanes. In all matters, it is better to retreat than advance; if impoverished, maintain one's integrity and cultivate one's character.		
		
Career: Fortune is unfavorable, and one should contemplate withdrawing from the public sphere, avoiding association with unscrupulous individuals. This does not mean passive evasion but rather preserving one’s strength, summarizing experiences, and seizing the right opportunity to reemerge. Be wary of rash actions that might cause unnecessary losses, and do not be tempted by small immediate benefits.		
		
Business: The market is in a state of decline, with unfavorable conditions. Do not insist on pursuing or invest blindly; remain calm and adhere to business ethics, stay away from petty individuals and unscrupulous merchants, preserve your strength, and wait for market conditions to improve before planning development.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Maintain your wisdom and be content to remain in seclusion, focusing on summarizing and improving efforts as preparation for a future return.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Do not rush to resolve matters, and do not act impulsively. When the time is ripe, approach it with sincerity and the right attitude.		
		
Decision-Making: In a period of decline where petty individuals are triumphant, blind actions will certainly lead to adversity. While it is unnecessary to repay evil with evil, do not align yourself with wrongdoing, thereby risking small losses for significant gains. Maintain discretion, conceal your abilities, preserve your strength, decisively move away, and avoid hesitation. Focus on the development of personal capabilities and wait patiently for the right moment. As long as one can steadfastly adhere to the righteous path and maintain integrity and fairness, one can reemerge and achieve great success when the time is right.
- Scholar Interpretation: Avoidance and withdrawal, when something reaches its peak, it must decline; words and actions should be strictly controlled, waiting for the right opportunity to act again. For one who receives this hexagram, it is advisable to retreat rather than advance. By retreating and defending, one can maintain personal safety, but reckless actions may invite disaster. It is wise to be cautious in words and actions and to act when the opportunity arises. Commentary by the great scholar Fu Peirong from Taiwan: Fortune: It is best to withdraw; the noble person finds good fortune. Financial fortune: Prices fluctuate greatly. Home: Beware of disturbances; marriage is not advisable. Health: Reside in a fortunate location.

### Line Information

    - Description: At the initial line six: When the noble person entirely withdraws, the state becomes endangered. There is nothing that can be done.

**Here's my question: Ask about family status**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step:

### Example 1

1. **Hexagram Description**: The hexagram "Duration" (Heng) is associated with success, stability, and perseverance. The interaction of Wind (Xun, below) and Thunder (Zhen, above) suggests cleansing and renewal.

2. **Elements and Relations**:
   - Line 3 features a Demons/Gold element, indicating pressure or obstacles in work. The spirits and elements of changed lines imply a change or necessity for adaptation.
   - Static lines, particularly the main one, suggest satisfaction or stability in the current scenario; thus, the work is seen as stable with manageable challenges.

3. **Overall Interpretation**:
   - The Demons line's strength suggests pressure but is manageable.

The expert uses the static main line to signify satisfaction and combines it with how strong the Demons line reflects some work pressure that’s controllable. 

### Example 2

1. **Hexagram Description**: The hexagram "Grace" (Pi) suggests success with minor gains. It involves enlightenment and inner support, symbolized by Fire below and Mountain above.

2. **Elements and Relations**:
   - Line 5, with Wife and Wealth and its vigor, indicates support or success in marriage.
   - Interpretation emphasizes the flourishing self-line, suggesting satisfaction but highlights the need for improvements or adjustments.

3. **Overall Interpretation**:
   - Emphasis on strong marital affection; highlights communication needs despite overall prosperity.

In this example, the emphasis is on the vigor of the Wife and Wealth line, showcasing a stable marital foundation but suggesting improvement in communication, influenced by the changes in lines reflecting dynamic interactions.

<analyze>
These interpretations use the interaction of the hexagram's lines, elements, and related attributes (like Demons, Wife and Wealth, etc.) to form insights into the question asked. The focus is on transitions, the role of static and dynamic lines, and how auxiliary relations and elements describe the situation's nuances.
</analyze>

<reason>
### Interpretation for Hexagram "Retreat" (Dun) on Family Status:

1. **Hexagram Overview**: 
   - "Retreat" indicates minor gain, with a focus on caution and withdrawal as a strategy to maintain safety and stability. Qian (Heaven) above and Gen (Mountain) below highlight the growth of Yin and decline of Yang, suggesting retreat when facing adversaries or challenges.

2. **Lines and Changes**:
   - **Line 1 (Parents, Shi/Ying Ying)**: Reflects peril and caution when withdrawing. The changed line indicates the necessity of returning to the right path for positive outcomes, suggesting resolving current family challenges demands right actions.
   - **Line 3 (Sibling, Shi)**: Being entangled; changing line emphasizes managing current resources rather than pursuing what is not secure, highlighting careful management and avoiding hasty family decisions.
   - **Line 6 (Parents, Shi/Ying Line changes)**: High, retreat; gives way to a situation of distress. The change signifies that binding conditions are reminiscent of difficult times, indicating vigilance in protecting the family from distressing situations.

3. **Elements and Interactions**:
   - Dominance of Soil and Water within changed lines suggests a cautious approach. Water nourishes Wood but is controlled by Earth. Hence, adaptative yet restrained interaction is advisable for the family.
   - Influences of spirits such as Vermilion Bird and Azure Dragon denote strong protective and auspicious symbols, urging to maintain family prosperity amidst challenges.

4. **Overall Analysis**:
   - The interpretation suggests that while current family dynamics might carry challenges needing strategic withdrawal or holding back, success and safety come from patiently maneuvering these conditions. Similar to the dynamics in "Retreat," emphasizing security over endeavor aligns with adopting attic reinforcement in family affairs to sustain the broader harmony.

Hence, your family status’s interpretation keys on strategic fertility, caution, and restrained optimism aligned with I Ching principles. The primary and modifying elements and associated spirits provide guidance about maintaining family well-being amidst dynamic circumstances.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram "Retreat" advises caution and strategic withdrawal to maintain family stability. Your current family status might face challenges, implying a need to retreat or hold back when faced with adversity. The key is to focus on security and cautious management of resources, avoiding hasty decisions. By maneuvering wisely and preserving strength, you can maintain harmony and ensure the prosperity of your family amidst changing circumstances.
