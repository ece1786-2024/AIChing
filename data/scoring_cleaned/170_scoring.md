Explanation:

1. **Deceased elder brother (Score: 1):** The standard answer mentions a deceased elder brother. This point is crucial because it provides personal and family context, and no equivalent point is found in the generated answer.

2. **Broad network of friends (Score: 1):** The standard response implies a sociable character and interpersonal bonds. This isn't covered by the generated answer, which emphasizes internal virtues such as patience and perseverance.

3. **Fell in love and worked diligently in ninety-nine (Score: 1):** The year ninety-nine is significant in terms of working while studying and love life, both of which shape the individual's destiny. The generated answer doesn't address any historical context or events, focusing instead on abstract advice.

4. **Average academic performance (Score: 1):** The standard answer provides an assessment of academic achievement, noting it as average, which can influence future opportunities and satisfaction levels. The generated answer does not make any mention of scholastic background or performance.

5. **Acceptable appearance (Score: 1):** This point touches on self-perception or societal adherence, and can affect one's social interactions. The generated answer does not address physical appearance or its influence on life aspects.

6. **Father's strong capabilities and robust health (Score: 1):** The mention of a robust father indicates family reliance or support, important for understanding familial influence on the individual's fate. The generated answer has no such correlating information.

7. **Family is not poor (Score: 1):** Economic stability is briefly noted, implying a lack of financial strain. The generated answer, though advising eventual prosperity, does not describe current socio-economic status.

8. **Illness and financial loss in July of year zero-three (Score: 1):** This point is critical for anticipating potential challenges and their timings. These specifics are absent from the generated answer, which remains vague on such occurrences.

9. **Relevance (Score: 2):** The generated answer can still potentially provide general advice and insight, although it is unrelated to the points listed in the standard answer. Since the generated answer presents a general fortune and life strategy but fails to relate to any specific aspect of the question asked, relevance remains low.
