## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The active element is at Shen, giving life to the self. During the Shen month, it should return, but in this hexagram, the day and month represent the original spirit, with all six lines quietly moving to give life again, transforming into a return to life. The original spirit is somewhat excessively strong; it should return when the original spirit is weak, likely during the Chou month, when the active element enters the tomb and impacts the changing line.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (Pǐ) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.		
		
Career: The situation is adverse, the career is in a declining phase, with many difficulties. There is interference from antagonistic people leading to frustration and many setbacks. One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.		
		
Home and dwelling: be diligent and frugal to avoid disaster; there is an indication of separation.

**Here's my question: A woman asked when her husband would be released from prison.**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
**Hexagram Analysis**

Let's begin by examining the primary hexagram for your query, Hexagram 12, Stagnation (Pǐ). This hexagram symbolizes a time of separation, obstruction, and impassability in affairs. The "Image" commentary emphasizes the lack of communication between Heaven and Earth, representing a state where no progress or thriving is possible. In terms of societal governance, it advises wise individuals to contemplate seclusion during obstructed times.

From a Five Elements perspective, Earth is below and Heaven is above, indicating a separation or detachment. This structure hints at yang energy rising and yin energy descending, leading to a lack of harmony.

Analyzing the six lines and given their traditional associations with the Six Relatives, it's clear that:

- **Line 1 (Parents, Vermilion Bird)**: Suggests pulling out negativity, perhaps indicating a first step toward resolving issues.
- **Line 2 (Demons, Hook Snake)**: Despite challenges, prudence and adherence to proper conduct are beneficial.
- **Line 3 (Wife and Wealth, Flying Serpent)**: Suggests feelings of inadequacy, potentially signaling a need to align talents with position.
- **Line 4 (Demons, White Tiger)**: Represents a period of potential danger yet implies rewards for faithfully fulfilling duties.
- **Line 5 (Sibling, Black Tortoise)**: Advises caution to avert downfall, with warnings about the fragility of the current situation.
- **Line 6 (Parents, Azure Dragon)**: Indicates an ending of misfortune, moving toward a better outcome.

The process of change in Lines 4 and 5, which involves earth and the transition to fire, then to water, respectively, suggests successive transformation moments that might link to the outcome's timeline.

**Explain Interpretation in Example:**

Let's analyze step by step how the interpretations in the examples were derived.

1. **Example 1:** The inference about timing is derived using both the Five Elements interaction and the observers' opportune moments. The return time is suggested by noting the Shen month, which aligns with water elements nourishing the situation. The day and month are seen as indications of when harmony facilitates the individual's willingness to return.

2. **Example 2:** The movement here is less about external factors and more related to the original spirit within the hexagram verses. They speak of strength during the Chou month, when the spirit weakens, indicating a release.

The interpretations harmonize by considering both the Five Elements context and the hexagram's change lines signaling progressive phases of the situation.

<analyze>
1. Both interpretations look for auspicious timings within the five elements and relate them to possible time frames.
2. Line changes and movements in the hexagrams give indications of situational shifts and the nature of interactions (e.g., rewards, danger, auspicious ends).
3. The examples apply the traditional meanings and images alongside analyzed time periods or celestial movements to predict the outcomes.
</analyze>

**Interaction and Reasoning**

Let's elaborate on the analysis patterns in your hexagram concerning your query:

1. **Element Analysis:** The earth's energy in the base trigrams suggests a slow-moving environment where patience will be crucial. The situation is temporarily stagnant due to impediments, with movement only notable when elements shift (change lines).

2. **Line Change Influence:** The changing line 4 indicates an imminent shift, aligning with the removal of danger, and line 5 supports a sequence where challenges may start to loosen as time progresses.

3. **Six Relatives and Spirit Dynamics:** Given the relation with demons and siblings, there is inner and external antagonism involved, reflecting the complexity of release from prison. However, elements shifting toward fire (dynamic interaction) and water (endings and transformations, per line 5's transition) suggest resolution approaches eventually.

4. **Outcome Projection:** Signals from elements and spironary images predict eventual movement from stagnation (obstruction) to a state where release becomes possible through disciplined patience.

<reason>
Looking at your hexagram and interpreting from the auspicious insights it holds, note that while initially stagnant, the predictive clarity comes as symbolic energies change. The phases appear to timely align the possibility of release after a period of expected endurance, indicating-awaited return, possibly after an elemental shift (intersection at a symbolic time of change).
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
A woman inquiring about her husband's release from prison receives Hexagram 12, Stagnation, which signifies blockage and impediment. This hexagram advises patience and caution due to unfavorable circumstances and obstruction.

Given the changing lines and the eventual shift toward better outcomes noted at Line 6, the release is projected to occur after enduring current challenges. The interpretation suggests significant delays, but with patience and perseverance, a positive shift may become possible, likely when the symbolic elements transition and align favorably.

In practical terms, this means the husband may not be released immediately. However, as circumstances evolve, a breakthrough could potentially come as obstructions diminish, possibly during a period marked by strategic changes or newfound opportunities. Patience and careful adherence to legal efforts or moral actions are advised.

Standard Answer: This hexagram suggests not to rush, wait for six days, and observe for news on the bingwu day. The husband is highly likely to be released from prison within two days, or he might also be released at night.
