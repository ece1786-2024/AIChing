        Hello, masters. I came here to ask for my fortune.
        First, please allow me to provide you some examples.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Abundance

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Abundance: Conducting a sacrificial ceremony, the king will personally visit the ancestral temple. Do not worry, the best time will be at noon.		
		
The Image Commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Zhen, representing Thunder; the lower trigram is Li, representing Lightning. The flashing lightning and rolling thunder are significant celestial phenomena, reflected in the imagery of the Abundance hexagram. Observing this hexagram image, the noble person is inspired by the brilliance and authority of the lightning and thunder, thereby rendering judgments in legal disputes and carrying out punishments.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is the superimposition of different trigrams (Li below, Zhen above), symbolizing thunder and lightning, representing tremendous achievements, akin to reaching the pinnacle, like the noonday sun. It serves as a warning: one must be vigilant about things developing in opposite directions, as prosperity and decline are perpetual, and one must remain cautious.		
		
Image: Thunder and lightning together evoke a powerful presence. Moreover, with the sun moving across the sky, illuminating the earth, all these signify grandness.		
		
Fortune: Fortune is exceptionally strong, and it is a time of harvest. However, one should avoid insatiable greed, seek contentment and happiness, and be on guard against disputes, financial losses, and even fire hazards.		
		
Career: This is a very prosperous time, with great success in all aspects. Nonetheless, one must pay attention to the early signs of decline and act to prevent it from worsening. Be wary of arrogance and complacency. Do not pursue unrealistic goals blindly and strive to prolong the current favorable situation.		
		
Business: By accurately grasping market trends, the business situation is very favorable for oneself, allowing for bold development. However, you must closely monitor market trends and analyze information, as a single careless mistake could lead to bankruptcy overnight. In case of bankruptcy, immediately summarize lessons learned, seek sincere partners, and recover from the adversity as quickly as possible.		
		
Reputation: After effort and struggle, achievements have been attained. Attention should be paid to maintaining and steadily developing them, and the pursuit of fame should be avoided.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Success and happiness are achievable, but if one side wavers due to changing conditions, it may lead to unfavorable outcomes.		
		
Decision-making: Due to personal intelligence and favorable conditions, all aspects proceed very smoothly. Nevertheless, it is essential to deeply understand the truth of life's impermanence. Everything should be kept in moderation, and remember that excess leads to reversal. One should not close oneself off, fall into difficulties, or become discouraged.
- Scholar Interpretation: Grand and abundant, bringing in wealth and profits; aspirations will be fulfilled, there will surely be celebrations. Those who receive this hexagram have strong fortunes, their endeavors can succeed, and they will gain both fame and wealth. However, one should not be overly greedy; contentment brings happiness, and caution is advised to avoid excessive joy turning into sorrow, potentially leading to financial loss or even fire hazards.		
		
Interpretation by Fu Peirong, a distinguished scholar from Taiwan:		
		
Fortune: Energetic and prosperous, be cautious and careful.		
Financial prospects: Profits are substantial, but legal issues should be guarded against.		
Household: Favorable direction is southeast; a match made in heaven.		
Health: Liver fire is rising, rest and calmness are recommended.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: The first line: When marrying off a daughter, accompany her with her younger sister as part of the dowry. Though lame, one can still walk. If this line is encountered in divination, it indicates a favorable outcome for travel. The commentary states: Marrying off a daughter along with her younger sister means the sisters are married to the same husband, which was a customary practice among ancient nobility in marriages. Though lame, one can still walk, and travel is favorable because the lame person receives help from others.
    - Element: ji mao wood, Relation: Children, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 2
    - Description: Sixty-two: Arrange the small mats and lie down to rest. At noon, someone claims to see the Big Dipper. It seems that someone among the travel companions is mentally disturbed. Stimulating him may help him regain clarity.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: With sincerity and integrity in mind, every word and action can manifest itself because it is a candid expression of one's true desires.
    - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: Lay straw thicker and rest upon it. At noon, this person again claims to have seen ghosts and spirits. Break his right arm. With this fright, perhaps he can find peace and clarity.		
		
The commentary says: Laying the straw thicker won’t accomplish much. Breaking his right arm would leave him disabled for life.
    - Element: ji hai water, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth place: The small mat is pieced together, and he lies down to rest. At noon, he still claims to see the Big Dipper, indicating he has not yet returned to normal. Fortunately, he meets his old shopkeeper, who takes him under his care, bringing tranquility and safety.		
		
The commentary says: Piecing together a small mat to rest anywhere indicates inappropriate circumstances, similar to the yang line of Nine in the Fourth Place positioned in a yin position. Seeing the Big Dipper at noon might be due to the sky being dark and unclear. Meeting his old shopkeeper is a fortunate journey.
    - Element: geng wu fire, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the fifth position: They acquire beautiful jade, and everyone celebrates and praises him. This is an auspicious omen.  		
The Commentary on the Image says:
    - Element: geng shen gold, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake

- Line 6
    - Description: Top six: The house is empty, with grass mats scattered on the roof. Peering through the door crack, there is not a single person in sight. It seems that no one has lived here for many years. This is an ominous sign.		
		
The Commentary on the Images says: Expanding and remodeling the house, it appears this person, like a bird flying in the blue sky, was content and prosperous, gaining considerable wealth. Peering through the door crack, there is not a single person in sight, suggesting that excessive wealth brought harm, leading to disaster, and he has fled to save his life.
    - Element: geng xu soil, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
Demons in the soil of the Xu are hollow and do not harm the primary line, indicating auspiciousness. The response line Demons in the soil of the Chou give life to the primary line, indicating auspiciousness.  

# Example 2

## Question: Will the unit send someone to a bad position, and would they go willingly?

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Breakthrough (Resoluteness)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Guai (Resoluteness): In the royal court, there is dancing and merrymaking. Someone announces, "Enemies are invading." An order is conveyed through the city: "Attacking is unfavorable, one must prepare defenses carefully." When encountering this line in divination, it is auspicious to travel abroad.		
		
The "Image" states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Dui, which represents a marsh, while the lower trigram is Qian, representing the sky. This signifies that the waters of the marsh rise, irrigating the earth, which is the image of the Guai hexagram. The noble person observes this image and thus extends beneficence downward, refraining from arrogance or self-congratulation, taking this as a caution.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a combination of different trigrams (with Qian below and Dui above). Qian represents heaven and strength; Dui represents marsh and joy. The energy from the marsh rises, accumulating and turning into rain, which falls upon the earth, nourishing all things. With five Yang lines and one Yin line, removing the Yin is not difficult—just resolve to remove it, hence the name "Guài," where "Guài" means decision.		
		
The Great Image: The accumulation of water in the marsh leads to flooding, a force swelling to the sky. The strength of the five Yang lines must inevitably remove the single Yin line, thus isolating it.		
		
Fortune: Although currently auspicious, difficulties and changes are brewing. It is advisable to remain vigilant, avoid arrogance, and guard against gossip and disputes.		
		
Career: While in a prosperous phase, latent dangers are being nurtured. It is essential to show kindness to others, not boast about achievements, actively unite with others, and avoid risky actions. Always stay alert to prevent sabotage by petty people, but avoid recklessness. Use gentle means to resolve issues with such people to prevent overdoing it.		
		
Business: The market is in a declining state; therefore, large activities are not advisable, and one should be ready to shift direction at any time. When exploring new areas, enhance collaboration with others, but be fully aware of opportunistic and treacherous individuals causing upheaval and disruption.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Be humble in seeking guidance and strengthen your abilities. Act within your means, do not blindly become overconfident, and avoid aligning with petty people seeking hollow reputations that can ruin your career.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Beware of being deceived by matchmakers, and be mindful of the other party's intentions.		
		
Decision-Making: With a contradictory nature, often appearing strong on the outside but weak inside, critical moments can ruin your career. Listen humbly to advice, refrain from rashness, contemplate deeply, and treat others and affairs with a gentle attitude.
- Scholar Interpretation: Exclude and eliminate with firm decisiveness; start with good fortune, end with misfortune, exercise caution and self-respect. 		
		
Those who obtain this hexagram will see their great fortune fade and difficulties approach. It is advisable to raise vigilance and be cautious in words and actions.		
		
Explanation by Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology:		
		
Time and Luck: Excessive fortune; dispersing wealth is beneficial.  		
Financial Luck: Beneficial to oneself and others; disperse wealth to gather people.  		
Home: Guard against water disasters; marriage will not succeed.  		
Health: Nurture and regulate your breath.  

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Initial Nine: The toes are injured, yet one continues to move forward, resulting in disaster due to insufficient strength in the feet.  		
The Commentary on the Image says: Continuing to move forward with insufficient strength in the feet will lead to disaster.
    - Element: jia zi water, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 2
    - Description: Nine in the second place: Shouting in fear, an enemy comes at night, but it is not enough to cause harm.  		
The "Xiang Ci" says: When an enemy comes, it is not enough to cause harm because the second line occupies the central position of the lower trigram, symbolizing a person who attains the way of moderation and correctness.
    - Element: jia yin wood, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Six in the second place: A woman has lost her headscarf. There is no need to search for it; within seven days, it can be regained without seeking. The Commentary on the Image states: It can be regained within seven days without seeking because the second line, being a yin line in a yin position, naturally fits its place, and what is lost will be returned.
        - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: Sibling

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: The cheekbones are wounded, which is an omen of misfortune. The superior person hurries along the road alone and encounters rain, becoming completely drenched, which is very unpleasant, but there is no calamity. The commentary states: The superior person hurries alone on the road, but in the end, there is no calamity.
    - Element: jia chen soil, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth position: The buttocks are injured, causing one to walk with a limp. Leading a sheep and losing it on the road leads to regret, because one did not believe in others' warnings. The Image says: The journey is difficult because the nine in the fourth position is a yang line in a yin place, resembling a person in an unfavorable situation. Not believing in others’ warnings indicates good hearing, but a lack of understanding.
    - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Line Six, Four: Supporting a boat patched with tattered cloth, one is anxious and apprehensive all day long.  		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Being anxious and apprehensive all day long indicates a mind full of doubts and concerns.
        - Element: wu shen gold, Relation: Children

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the Fifth Position: A goat with small horns leaps along the middle of the road. For someone casting this hexagram, there will be no misfortune.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: Walking the path of what is just and correct, only barely avoiding misfortune, suggests that the way of moderation and integrity is not being fully extended and applied.
    - Element: ding you gold, Relation: Children, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Six: The dog is howling, portending that ultimately there will be misfortune.  		
The Xiang Commentary states: When a country lacks order, its situation inevitably faces danger, indicating that the nation's fortune is declining, ultimately unable to be preserved.
    - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Demons of yin wood move to overcome the ruling line, while the Sibling of wei soil represents colleagues. When in a cycle of void, it does not effectively overcome the ruling line, which is unfavorable.  

        Here's the information about the hexagram(s) I got:
