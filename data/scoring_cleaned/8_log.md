## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gu: Great fortune and prosperity. It is beneficial for crossing water or rivers, but one must begin the journey on a day of Xin three days before the day of Jia or on a day of Ding three days after the day of Jia.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing the wind. The virtuous person resides like a mountain at the top, spreading moral teachings below. This is described as the wind beneath the mountain, an image of the Xun hexagram. A noble person observing this hexagram takes inspiration from the wind that blows across all things, rescuing the populace and implementing moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: The hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Xun, above is Gen) stacked together and is mutually complementary with the Sui hexagram. The original meaning of Gu is matter, which extends to trouble and chaos. Vessels that remain unused for a long time breed worms, symbolizing a world that has been stable for too long and has grown stagnant and corrupt, necessitating innovation, creation, governance, rectification, crisis resolution, and revitalization of business.		
		
The Image: The wind enters beneath the mountain, closed without exit, leading to decay and breeding of worms. Enthusiasm is blocked, leading to ruin through stagnation.		
		
Fortune: Everything is unsatisfactory, difficult, and confusing. It is advisable to make bold innovations; otherwise, it will lead to domestic and foreign troubles.		
		
Career: Luck is in a poor state, either due to external conditions or personal factors. Only by careful analysis of the reasons and identifying the drawbacks, with decisive and bold action, even at the risk of adventure, can obstacles be overcome. At this time, one must keep a calm mind and consult with wise people to create achievements.		
		
Business: Many disadvantages are troubling you, and it is not advisable to continue on the old path. A comprehensive analysis of market trends is needed to make decisive changes and seek alternative routes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Many difficulties and disadvantages will be encountered, which should be viewed as tests of oneself. With exceptional courage, continue to strive, while also humbly searching for one’s shortcomings and remedying them.		
		
Marriage and Love: Unsuccessful. If both parties are in love, they should go all out to bring about this matter, with the couple working together to maintain the family.		
		
Decision-Making: Born out of time, the family's or career's decline is evident, and one is in a troublesome period. Only by facing reality, being diligent, persevering, and achieving something, even at the risk of adventure, can the declining situation be salvaged. It is also necessary to patiently wait for the right opportunity when required.
- Scholar Interpretation: Three vessels are in ruin; things fall apart. With diligence and care, transformation from danger to safety is possible. For those who receive this hexagram, it is a time of difficulty and confusion, where nothing goes as desired. It is advisable to be bold in innovation, strive for improvement, and work hard, for danger can be transformed into safety.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Peirong:		
		
Timely fortune: Strive to make progress; old perspectives can change.		
		
Wealth: Accumulation is not advisable; sell promptly.		
		
Home: Rectify family conduct; be wary of personal affairs; childbirth may be problematic.		
		
Health: Poisonous ailments; be cautious of curses.

### Line Information

    - Element: xin chou soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon

- Line 2
    - Description: Nine in the second place: By inheriting the mother's business, neither good nor bad fortune can be divined.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Inheriting the mother's business, the line at the second position is in the correct central place of the lower trigram, indicating the person has attained the way of moderation and correctness.

The Commentary on the Image says: "Long-term good fortune without misfortune," because the yielding line in the second position of the lower hexagram symbolizes a person who firmly upholds the correct path and never changes.
        - Element: yi si fire, Relation: Children

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third position: Inheriting the father's profession, even if there are minor mistakes, it will not lead to major problems.

    - Spirit: Flying Serpent
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.		
		
The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.
        - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Parents

- Line 5
    - Description: Six in the fifth place: Inheriting the father's profession and gaining acclaim.

The Commentary on the Image says: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results merely in the absence of disaster because one's talents are low and cannot achieve anything substantial.
        - Element: ding you gold, Relation: Demons

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Does not serve kings or princes, for this person values their own worth.

    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.		
		
The "Xiang" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.
        - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
When the Parents line is prosperous and active, it indicates that the property conditions are ideal. The World line is still, reminding the seeker to seize the opportunity to avoid missing out.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Difficulty at the Beginning

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Tun. Great fortune and benefit, auspicious divination. It is not favorable to venture out. It is favorable to establish a state and confer a title.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: The upper trigram of Tun is Kan, representing clouds, and the lower trigram is Zhen, representing thunder. Clouds move above, and thunder moves below, forming the image of the hexagram Tun. The noble person observes this hexagram's image and emulates the qualities of clouds and thunder, using the grace of clouds and the majesty of thunder to govern state affairs.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the superimposition of different trigrams (Zhen below, Kan above). Zhen represents thunder, symbolizing movement; Kan represents rain, symbolizing danger. The combination of thunder and rain indicates a tumultuous and perilous situation with a harsh environment. Originally, "Tun" referred to the sprouting of plants on earth, the beginning of all things, full of difficulties and obstacles. However, if one goes with the times and responds appropriately, prosperity is inevitable.		
		
Great Image: "Tun" signifies difficulty, as everything is attempting to proceed but cannot advance.

Great success is possible if opportunities are seized at the right time, though not hastily, as obstacles remain and assistance from others is essential. Hence, one should frequently offer favors in ordinary times.		
		
Business: At the start of an enterprise, the path is difficult with many setbacks. Firm belief is most important. One should not be misled by surface appearances, but strive forward with decisiveness to find a way out. If difficulties persist, it is advised to retreat and safeguard, awaiting the opportunity for future plans.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Actively strive and pursue, success is attainable.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Good things come with difficulties, but with fidelity and purity, bold pursuit will lead to success and a happy marriage.

Often, lack of understanding from others can lead to loneliness and distress, leaving one's career in a difficult state. Assistance from virtuous people is required to overcome this. If one can live with an optimistic spirit, achievements can be made.
- Scholar Interpretation: All things begin to come into life with initial difficulty; first labor and then ease, bitterness is followed by sweetness. Those who receive this hexagram find themselves in a predicament, it is better to hold steady rather than advance, requiring much hard work and effort to overcome difficulties, only then can they achieve success, embodying the notion of initial difficulty followed by resolution. 		
		
Fortunes: Better to hold steady than to advance.		
Financial luck: Starting a business is arduous.		
Home: Repair the dwelling; initial marriage discord.		
Health: Preserve vitality.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Initial Nine: Hesitating and difficult to advance. This is favorable for residential divination. When encountering this line, it is advantageous for establishing a state or becoming a lord.  		
The "Image" says: Although it is hesitant and difficult to advance, the resolve is firm and correct. The Initial Nine is below the second line, which is yin, symbolizing the noble yielding to the lowly, thereby greatly winning the people's support.

    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Initial Six: In the midst of the pit of Abyss, there is yet another pit of Abyss, falling into a deep pit, ominous.  		
The "Image" says: "In the midst of the pit of Abyss, there is yet another pit of Abyss, falling into a deep pit." When one does not take the straightforward path but insists on traversing a dangerous road, it will surely lead to disaster.
        - Element: wu yin wood, Relation: Children

- Line 2
    - Description: Sixty-two: Hesitant to proceed. Walking the road in hesitation, the carriage circles in place, not coming to rob, but to welcome a bride. This divination for the woman shows she cannot conceive, taking ten years before becoming pregnant.		
		
The Commentary says: The line of sixty-two suggests difficulty, as it is positioned above the initial nine yang line. A ten-year wait before pregnancy is an abnormal occurrence.
    - Element: geng yin wood, Relation: Children, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the second place: Pitfalls and obstacles, the path has dangers and obstructions. Daring to walk the perilous path may lead to some small gains.

        - Element: wu chen soil, Relation: Demons

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the Third Place: In chasing the wild deer, there is no official serving as a guide. Reflecting on it, the deer escape into the mountains and forests. The noble person, with foresight, considers it better to give up. Entering deep into the forests, he thinks it will be dangerous.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: In chasing the wild deer, without an official serving as a guide, the intention is in pursuing the wild beasts. The noble person gives up on pursuing the wild deer, understanding that going deep into the forests would be dangerous, thus there is no other course.
    - Element: geng hen soil, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird

    - Description: Nine in the Fifth Place: Accumulating fat meat. When this line is encountered in divination, asking about minor matters is auspicious, while asking about major matters is inauspicious. The Commentary on the Image says: "Accumulating fat meat," which means that one’s generosity is not widespread.
    - Element: wu xu soil, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

- Line 6
    - Description: At the top line: The carriage turns in place, silent in its weeping, tears streaming continuously. The commentary says: Silent in its weeping, tears streaming continuously, how can this situation endure for long?
    - Element: wu zi water, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The hexagram is unfavorable. Although the Children line is active, it is subject to emptiness, which may hinder the handling of the stall-related matters. It is advised to make thorough preparations and patiently wait for the right opportunity before taking action.  

        Here's the information about the hexagram(s) I got:

**Here's my question: How to successfully set up a stall somewhere? Can it be approved or not?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

### Example 1 Analysis
1. **Hexagram Overview**:
    - The primary hexagram is "Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)", with components of the upper Gen (mountain) and lower Xun (wind) trigrams.
    - The interpretation suggests difficulty and confusion that needs addressing through innovation and bold action.

2. **Line Analysis**:
    - Line 2 (Parents, Water element) is changed and seen as prosperous and active, indicating ideal property conditions.
    - The World line is static, prompting timely action or opportunity might be lost.
  
3. **Additional Influences**:
    - The emphasis on rectifying current conditions could hint towards timely improvements or decisions in property matters.

The interpretation focuses on the prosperous line concerning the Parents and associates it with ideal conditions necessary for purchasing a property, reflecting the dynamics in familial lineage (i.e., generational continuation, as suggested by the Parents line) and timing (prompt action due to line stillness).

### Example 2 Analysis
1. **Hexagram Overview**:
    - The primary hexagram is "Difficulty at the Beginning", with an indication of obstacles and initial hardship transitioning to potential prosperity if properly navigated.
   
2. **Line Analysis**:
    - Children line is active but met with emptiness, implying difficulties in beginning the endeavour.
  
3. **Suggestion**:
    - Decisive preparation and waiting for the better opportunity rather than rushing into uncertain conditions.

The consultation emphasizes foundational challenges and recommends patience and preparation before action, owing to the line about children being active yet empty, which impedes immediate progress.

<analyze>
Analyzing both examples indicates a systematic approach to interpreting the hexagrams through assessing line descriptions, elements, changes, and how these interact with the current inquiry. The focus lies on recognizing strengths (active/prosperous lines), weaknesses (empty lines or stillness), and interpreting dynamics according to relationship and elemental context. 

The advised actions align with these insights, such as making use of favorable conditions (active lines) or holding back where intervention is needed (empty lines).
</analyze>

Now let's proceed with your query based on the hexagram information.

<reason>
### Your Question: How to successfully set up a stall somewhere? Can it be approved or not?
    
1. **Hexagram Overview**:
    - The primary hexagram is "Difficulty at the Beginning", indicating initial hardships, but with potential resolutions through careful and strategic actions.
   
2. **Element and Line Analysis**:
    - **Line 1 (Sibling, Water Element)**: Represents inner conflicts or hesitation about the venture, suggesting a need for clarity before proceeding.
    - **Line 2 (Children, Wood Element)**: Initially finds restraint (hesitation leading to delays), later reveals potential for small gains.
    - **Line 1 change**: Reflects ominous implications when ignoring straightforward paths, reinforcing the need for cautious advancement.

3. **Additional Influences**:
    - The hexagram suggests non-outward movement initially, aligning with the idea of preparation and securing the current state rather than expansion.
    - With the Children's line active, though met with difficulties in the initial position, there is openness for growth post-preparation. 

4. **Interpretation Direction**:
    - Strategize your approach keeping in mind the environmental and circumstantial constraints initially present.
    - Await until conditions align more favorably, as premature actions might not yield desired outcomes.
    
Given the energy of the hexagram, the initial efforts might encounter resistance; hence, ensuring foundational stability and waiting for opportune times would be more beneficial, enabling successful establishment when these challenges subside.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Your venture of setting up a stall is likely to face initial obstacles and delays, as indicated by the hexagram "Difficulty at the Beginning." Approval might not come immediately. It's important to thoroughly prepare and strategically plan your approach while remaining cautious. Once you've established a solid foundation and circumstances become more favorable, you'll find better success and growth. Patience and readiness will be key to navigating this early stage effectively.

Standard Answer: The changing line of Children indicates that the matter may eventually succeed, but the current resistance is significant, requiring flexible responses. It is advised to prepare documentation in advance, communicate with relevant departments, and strive to submit the application at a favorable opportunity.
