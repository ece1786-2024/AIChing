## Question: Annual Fortune




# 

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (Pǐ) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.		
		
Career: The situation is adverse, the career is in a declining phase, with many difficulties. There is interference from antagonistic people leading to frustration and many setbacks. One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.		
		
Home and dwelling: be diligent and frugal to avoid disaster; there is an indication of separation.

## Question: Divination of the Daily Financial Fortune




# 

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Grace

### General Information

- Description: The Pi Hexagram: Success. There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  		
  		
The "Image" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.		
		
Great Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.		
		
Fortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.		
		
Career: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.		
		
Business: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.		
		
Reputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.		
		
Decision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.
- Scholar Interpretation: Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one's capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one's capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: In the first nine, wearing flower-decorated shoes, one refrains from getting on the carriage, choosing to walk on foot.

    - Element: ji mao wood, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Hook Snake

- Line 2
    - Description: Six in the second place: Trim one's beard.  		
The "Image" says: Trimming one's beard suggests an elder who does not concede to old age, assisting the ruler in revitalizing the state.
    - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: Running forward, dripping with sweat. Divination about long-term misfortune and fortune yields a favorable omen.

    - Element: ji hai water, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Six in the third position: Deviating from the proper way of nurturing life, relying on unorthodox and depraved methods for living, the divination presents an omen of misfortune. For ten years, one will experience bad luck and gain no benefits.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Experiencing bad luck for ten years is due to such actions greatly contradicting moral principles.
        - Element: geng hen soil, Relation: Sibling

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Running out of breath, the sun blazing hot. A tall white horse gallops forward. It is not coming to raid, but to marry.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The yin line in the fourth place is in its proper position. Knowing it is not coming to raid, but to marry, dispels doubts, and in the end, there will be no calamity.
    - Element: bing xu soil, Relation: Sibling,

    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: The white silk adorned with multicolored patterns signifies no disaster, because the Top Nine occupies the premier position in the hexagram, like a person in a high position, content and satisfied.
    - Element: bing yin wood, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The inner hexagram has Wife and Wealth in water of Hai, positioned at the peak of prosperity, moving to produce the representing line, which is unfavorable. The outer hexagram has Wife and Wealth in water of Zi, being void for ten days, which is favorable.

**Here's my question: Analysis of Wealth Fortune**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

<analyze>
### Example 1 Analysis: Annual Fortune
1. **Hexagram Identification:**
   - The primary hexagram in this example is "Stagnation" (Pi), which symbolizes separation and obstruction caused by petty people. The analysis begins with understanding the fortune themes such as career, business, and marriage.

2. **Element, Relation, and Spirit Interaction:**
   - The analysis first focuses on the generating and overcoming cycles between elements. For instance, the wood of Mao generating the fire of Si shows supportive interaction.
   - The relations and six spirits are also brought in, focusing on the specific line relations, such as Demons and the White Tiger, to provide additional depth to the interpretation.

3. **Interpretation of Changed Lines:**
   - For changed lines, the transformation from one state to another is discussed. For instance, how the rewards transform into danger or how mindfulness could overcome challenges.
   - Additionally, the ending predictions suggest an eventual positive outcome through patience and adherence to a righteous path.

### Example 2 Analysis: Divination of the Daily Financial Fortune
1. **Hexagram Identification:**
   - The "Grace" hexagram is associated with small gains and external appearance. It discusses how enlightenment with restraint impacts fortune.

2. **Element, Relation, and Spirit Interaction:**
   - Elemental interaction is considered, such as water of Hai and Wife and Wealth relation, indicating potential but needing suitable conditions.
   - The spirits, like the White Tiger, illustrate the adversities or protection aspects.

3. **Line Changes and Their Effects:**
   - The effects of line changes show how elements and spirits transition, impacting the interpretation of fortune such as potential obstacles being overcome through suitable adjustments.
   - Emphasis is on planning and internal enrichment despite external glamour.

Both examples focus on hexagram symbolism, element interactions, and the consequences of line changes to draw insights. The examples demonstrate how combinations of elements, relations, and spirits suggest inclinations towards certain actions or outcomes.

<reason>
Given the information about the "Grace" hexagram in your question about wealth fortune, let's identify and analyze significant factors involved and their influence.

1. **Hexagram Symbolism:**
   - The "Grace" or "Bi" hexagram displays success with external appeal but potential internal hollowness. This indicates small, steady advancement when actions are informed and calculated—much like wealth building, where an external show does not mirror internal strength.

2. **Interactions of Elements and Relations:**
   - Since the "Grace" hexagram has Fire (Li) beneath the Mountain (Gen), it describes elements where brightness and stopping influences require cautious advancement. In the context of wealth, this reflects the necessity to look beyond surface appeal and prepare for longer-term rewards.
   - Analyze any prevalent cycles: Are there opportunities where Fire enriches or controls development akin to a business warming up or reputations needing clarity? Look at opposing or Dutchative interactions from relations such as Sibling or Wife and Wealth that might evoke disruptions or enhancements in your pursuit.

3. **Significance of Spirits:**
   - Spirits such as Azure Dragon and White Tiger emphasize aggression or strategic communication, useful for navigating wealth endeavors due to their protective or challenging nature. The presence of Flying Serpent highlights transformation and news that could deliver unforeseen financial progress or obstacles.

4. **Line Transitions and Changes:**
   - Lines with transformation propose necessary actions or adjustments. Changed lines highlight shifts from worldly entanglement to a more spiritually guided interaction. Assess involved line transformations that could signify hidden risks or investment potential about wealth.

These intricacies suggest a wealth analysis reliant on recognizing the balance between overt appearances and foundational strength, dictated by planned actions, self-reflection, and the guidance of inner virtues over temporary gains. Integrate this with understanding of market realities or collaborative endeavors that align with the attributes of the "Grace" and its elemental, relational interactions.

Moreover, if these elements display suitable progression, they foreshadow gradual but potential fortune development by caution against being deceived by surface promises, urging for inner richness and insight-led endeavors.
</reason>

Reflect on the hexagram's emphasis on substance over appearances to form a strategic and enriching approach towards your wealth fortune. Explore how the elements, relations, and spirits in your specific context offer indications for maximized prosperity while minding potential adversities.
Rational_Agent: 
Based on the "Grace" hexagram related to your wealth fortune, the message is clear: prioritize substance over appearance. While things may seem appealing on the surface, true prosperity lies in building a solid foundation.

**Key Advice:**
1. **Internal Enrichment**: Focus on genuine growth and understanding rather than surface-level gains. It's crucial to deepen your knowledge and skills.
   
2. **Steady Approach**: Make informed decisions, avoiding impulsive actions. Gradual and thoughtful moves will yield more substantial rewards in the long run.

3. **Caution and Insight**: Do not be misled by appearances or temporary successes. Evaluate opportunities carefully, ensuring they align with your long-term goals.

4. **Strategic Collaboration**: Engage with others wisely, building networks that genuinely support your ambitions rather than simply expand your visible profile.

The path to financial prosperity involves a commitment to nurtured growth and authenticity, protected by discernment and strategic connections. Use these insights to enrich your journey purposely, ensuring stability beyond what meets the eye.

Standard Answer: The hexagram suggests that the current emphasis should be on accumulation and caution against taking risks. If you need to start a new project, it is advisable to control risks and patiently wait for a better opportunity for financial luck.
