## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Possession in Great Measure

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Great Possession: Prosperous and Unimpeded.		
		
The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.		
		
Fame: Some reputation has been gained, but do not become complacent and stagnant. Avoid indulging in worldly affairs, and continue striving upward with the help of true friends to reach new heights.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: With superior conditions, many choices are available, so it is best to proceed cautiously. Efforts should be made to maintain the family for both parties.		
		
Decision-Making: With a strong personality, courageous in overcoming difficulties, striving for progress. Numerous challenges and misfortunes arise on the path forward, and only by taking them seriously can continual success be achieved. If vigilance is relaxed, arrogance and complacency will lead to disastrous failure. Many friends and extensive social interactions can greatly aid the career, though there may also be malicious individuals attempting to undermine.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun is bright in the sky, shining upon all things; it is magnificent and prosperous, maintaining abundance and stability. Those who receive this hexagram are enjoying good fortune, with everything auspicious and great harvests, but they should be wary of the principle that extremes lead to reversal, and that at the peak of prosperity, decline may follow. 		
		
Fortunes: Unparalleled smoothness and outstanding brilliance.  		
Wealth: Proceed boldly, and wealth will come naturally.  		
Family: A household that accumulates good deeds, with descendants preserving it.  		
Health: Rising false fire, be careful with treatment.

The Commentary on the Image says: The reason the gathered multitude first cries and then laughs (as the tide of battle turns from defeat to victory) is because this line is encountered in divination, with the nine in the fifth place occupying the central position of the upper trigram. This resembles one who adheres to the path of rectitude and correctness, thus necessarily turning misfortune into fortune. The joining of the large forces signifies that our army has overwhelmed the enemy.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Work on What Has Been Spoiled (Decay)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Gu: Great fortune and prosperity. It is beneficial for crossing water or rivers, but one must begin the journey on a day of Xin three days before the day of Jia or on a day of Ding three days after the day of Jia.		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, representing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Xun, representing the wind. The virtuous person resides like a mountain at the top, spreading moral teachings below. This is described as the wind beneath the mountain, an image of the Xun hexagram. A noble person observing this hexagram takes inspiration from the wind that blows across all things, rescuing the populace and implementing moral teachings.
- Traditional Interpretation: The hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Xun, above is Gen) stacked together and is mutually complementary with the Sui hexagram. The original meaning of Gu is matter, which extends to trouble and chaos. Vessels that remain unused for a long time breed worms, symbolizing a world that has been stable for too long and has grown stagnant and corrupt, necessitating innovation, creation, governance, rectification, crisis resolution, and revitalization of business.		
		
The Image: The wind enters beneath the mountain, closed without exit, leading to decay and breeding of worms. Enthusiasm is blocked, leading to ruin through stagnation.		
		
Fortune: Everything is unsatisfactory, difficult, and confusing. It is advisable to make bold innovations; otherwise, it will lead to domestic and foreign troubles.		
		
Career: Luck is in a poor state, either due to external conditions or personal factors. Only by careful analysis of the reasons and identifying the drawbacks, with decisive and bold action, even at the risk of adventure, can obstacles be overcome. At this time, one must keep a calm mind and consult with wise people to create achievements.		
		
Business: Many disadvantages are troubling you, and it is not advisable to continue on the old path. A comprehensive analysis of market trends is needed to make decisive changes and seek alternative routes.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Many difficulties and disadvantages will be encountered, which should be viewed as tests of oneself. With exceptional courage, continue to strive, while also humbly searching for one’s shortcomings and remedying them.		
		
Marriage and Love: Unsuccessful. If both parties are in love, they should go all out to bring about this matter, with the couple working together to maintain the family.		
		
Decision-Making: Born out of time, the family's or career's decline is evident, and one is in a troublesome period. Only by facing reality, being diligent, persevering, and achieving something, even at the risk of adventure, can the declining situation be salvaged. It is also necessary to patiently wait for the right opportunity when required.
- Scholar Interpretation: Three vessels are in ruin; things fall apart. With diligence and care, transformation from danger to safety is possible. For those who receive this hexagram, it is a time of difficulty and confusion, where nothing goes as desired. It is advisable to be bold in innovation, strive for improvement, and work hard, for danger can be transformed into safety.		
		
Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar, Fu Peirong:		
		
Timely fortune: Strive to make progress; old perspectives can change.		
		
Wealth: Accumulation is not advisable; sell promptly.		
		
Home: Rectify family conduct; be wary of personal affairs; childbirth may be problematic.		
		
Health: Poisonous ailments; be cautious of curses.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Inheriting the father's business, there is a filial son. Although there is no disaster, even if encountering danger, it ultimately leads to good fortune. The commentary says: Inheriting the father's business means continuing the father's legacy.
    - Element: xin chou soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon

- Line 2
    - Description: Nine in the second place: By inheriting the mother's business, neither good nor bad fortune can be divined.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Inheriting the mother's business, the line at the second position is in the correct central place of the lower trigram, indicating the person has attained the way of moderation and correctness.
    - Element: xin xuan water, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Vermilion Bird
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Six in the second place: Obtaining this line indicates long-term good fortune without misfortune. Divining about sacrificial rites, the omen shows that for the spring sacrifice, it is favorable to use prisoners as offerings. 		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: "Long-term good fortune without misfortune," because the yielding line in the second position of the lower hexagram symbolizes a person who firmly upholds the correct path and never changes.
        - Element: yi si fire, Relation: Children

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third position: Inheriting the father's profession, even if there are minor mistakes, it will not lead to major problems.

        - Description: Line three: Worry and lament. Obtaining this line in divination is of no benefit. There are no disasters in travel, but there are minor troubles.		
		
The commentary states: No disasters in travel, because the line three yin position is below the line four yang position, resembling a subordinate being obedient to a superior, behaving with caution.
        - Element: yi mao wood, Relation: Sibling

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth position: To expand and illuminate one's father's enterprise is fraught with difficulty.  		
The commentary states: Expanding and illuminating one's father's enterprise faces significant challenges as the execution is not entirely appropriate.
    - Element: bing xu soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.		
		
The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.
        - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Parents

- Line 5
    - Description: Six in the fifth place: Inheriting the father's profession and gaining acclaim.  		
The Image says: To inherit the father's profession and gain acclaim is due to inheriting the father's virtuous qualities.
    - Element: bing zi water, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the fifth place: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results in no disaster. Do not lightly punish others. Inquiring about long-term fortune or misfortune, the oracle shows that there will be no great regret.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: To exhaust one's mind and strength in duty results merely in the absence of disaster because one's talents are low and cannot achieve anything substantial.
        - Element: ding you gold, Relation: Demons

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Does not serve kings or princes, for this person values their own worth.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: Not serving kings or princes; such aspiration is exemplary.
    - Element: bing yin wood, Relation: Sibling, 
    - Spirit: Black Tortoise
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.		
		
The "Xiang" commentary says: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, because the Top Six line is at the end of a hexagram, hanging alone without support, like a person in a high position but as if walking on thin ice, living in fear day by day.
        - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Wife and Wealth

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
When the Parents line is prosperous and active, it indicates that the property conditions are ideal. The World line is still, reminding the seeker to seize the opportunity to avoid missing out.  

        Here's the information about the hexagram(s) I got:

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Duration

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Heng: Success, absence of fault, auspicious divination. There is benefit in having a purpose.		
		
The Xiangci commentary states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Zhen, which represents thunder, and the lower trigram is Xun, which represents wind. The interaction of wind and thunder cleanses, and the universe is ever-renewed; this is the symbolism of the Heng hexagram. The junzi, observing this symbolism, stands firmly on the path of righteousness, steadfast and unwavering.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is a combination of different trigrams (Xun below, Zhen above). Zhen represents the male and thunder; Xun represents the female and wind. Zhen's firmness is above, while Xun's gentleness is below. With firmness above and gentleness below, creation follows its usual course, mutually supporting growth. Yin and yang correspond, a usual state, hence it is called Heng (Perseverance).		
		
Great Image: Zhen symbolizes movement, suitable for outward development. Xun signifies entering and being inward. One inside, one outside, each occupying its position, thus achieving eternity, symbolizing the path of husband and wife.		
		
Prosperity: All matters are prosperous, continually striving yields good fortune, maintaining one's role is auspicious, acting rashly invites disaster.		
		
Career: Everything is accomplished through perseverance, and with perseverance comes success. Perseverance is the foundation of success. Therefore, the motive must be pure, remaining composed and not restless, neither rushing toward success nor rigidly adhering to a dead-end path. Start from personal realities. The greatest taboo is blind conformity, and the most favorable is adaptability. In this way, all matters will succeed smoothly.		
		
Business: Take bold actions; every venture has its advantages. Pay attention to market trends and the surrounding environment. Adapt business strategies as needed, yet do not deviate from common principles and norms. Stick to carefully chosen directions and do not follow the trends. Avoid reckless adventurism.		
		
Pursuit of Reputation: From beginning to end, start well and finish well, stand on the right path, and persistently strive. Especially in learning, improve cultivation, and success will follow.		
		
Marriage and Romance: The road to good things is often bumpy and fraught with complications. However, do not be fickle or change heart, seek harmonious coexistence, and do not stubbornly insist on your own views.		
		
Decision-making: Proceed step-by-step without expecting too much initially, yet do not abandon your pursuit because of this. Be grounded and start pragmatically, avoid being overly ambitious, do not overestimate your abilities, and avoid risky and aggressive actions. Do not be capricious. Believe in the ever-renewing universe, continuously adjust your insights, and supplement with new content.
- Scholar Interpretation: Constant and enduring, long-lasting and unchanging; the noble one benefits by not changing his principles. Those who receive this hexagram must uphold righteousness, remain steadfast, and persist with effort to achieve success. Those who lack perseverance and are inconsistent will not succeed. Fu Peirong, an esteemed scholar of traditional Chinese culture, explains:		
		
Fortune: Work hard; do not be impetuous.  		
Wealth: In trade, do not change locations.  		
Home: Do not change direction; enjoy a harmonious union.  		
Health: Shortness of breath with phlegm, persist with the old remedy.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Continuous digging, without ceasing, leads to divination of peril, offering no benefit. The peril of continuous digging arises because seeking depth recklessly inevitably leads to the disaster of collapse.

    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Initial Nine: The sound of thunder arrives, causing one to tremble all over. Later, upon hearing the sound of thunder again, one remains cheerful as usual, which is auspicious.  		
The Commentary on the Image says: The sound of thunder arrives, causing one to tremble all over, because believing in and respecting the significant celestial phenomena can absolve one from guilt and bring blessings. Later, to remain cheerful as usual upon hearing the thunder indicates that one has gained some experience with such occurrences.
        - Element: geng zi water, Relation: Parents

- Line 2
    - Description: There are no regrets in moving past one's position.

        - Description: Line two: Thunder and lightning converge, creating extreme danger. In the state of panic, money is lost. Despite traversing mountains and crossing great distances in search, it cannot be found. The diviner advises him, "No need to pursue it further. Within seven or eight days, this loss can be compensated."		
		
The Commentary on the Image states: During the time of converging thunder and lightning, crossing over nine-fold mountains, the hexagram image indicates that the person has encountered thunder and lightning, facing a perilous situation.
        - Element: geng yin wood, Relation: Sibling

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third position: Unable to maintain one's virtue, inevitably one will face humiliation. Divination results indicate a sign of difficulty.

    - Spirit: Flying Serpent

- Line 5
    - Description: Nine in the fifth position: Consistent conduct. Divination brings good fortune to women, while it is dangerous for men.   		
The "Image" commentary says: The line statement indicates that women maintain chastity and virtue, which is auspicious. This aligns with the principle of a wife following her husband throughout life. For men, however, events dictate propriety, and their paths are varied. If one tries to bind a man with feminine virtues, it will surely lead to danger.
    - Element: geng shen gold, Relation: Demons, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger

- Line 6
    - Description: Top six: Continual movement without rest leads to danger.

**Here's my question: Can the certain investment in item be made?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Certainly, let's proceed with the analysis and interpretation of your hexagram using the examples you provided as a guide.

### Hexagram Analysis

**Primary Hexagram: Duration (Heng)**

#### General Information:

- **Description:** The hexagram signifies success, absence of fault, and benefits from having a purpose. It emphasizes steadfastness, long-lasting continuity, and maintaining a righteous path.
- **Traditional Interpretation:** With Zhen (Thunder) on top and Xun (Wind) below, it encourages perseverance. The firmness and gentleness of these trigrams highlight mutual growth, with yin and yang in balance. 
- **Prosperity:** Perseverance leads to success, and acting rashly invites disaster. 
- **Career & Business:** Everything is dependent on perseverance—success follows those who remain steadfast without rushing or adhering to false paths. One must understand and adapt to circumstances without engaging in reckless behavior.
- **Marriage & Decision-Making:** Consistency and perseverance in relationships and pursuits are valued. Caution against fickleness and rash decisions.

#### Line Information:

- **Line 1:** Continuous digging without ceasing warns of the danger of collapse. The subsequent changed line implies optimism and dancing with celestial timing.
- **Line 2:** Moving past one's position involves no regrets. The changed line reflects sudden danger and subsequent recovery.
- **Line 3:** Failure to maintain virtue leads to challenges, while the changed line suggests hesitation but ultimately provides clarity for action.
- **Line 4:** Nothing is caught in a hunt, signifying remaining too long in the wrong environment.
- **Line 5:** Steadfast conduct is perilous for men but fortunate for women, emphasizing different roles and responsibilities.
- **Line 6:** Constant movement without rest indicates danger due to inconsistency.

### Explain Interpretaton in Example

Let's analyze step by step how the examples provided interpret the hexagrams:

**Example 1:**

1. **Primary Hexagram:** "Possession in Great Measure" suggests prosperous investment opportunities.
2. **Changed Lines:** The Wife and Wealth line's activity signals favorable investment outcomes, while a World line transforming into retreat urges caution—not to be overambitious or hasty.

**Example 2:**

1. **Primary Hexagram:** "Work on What Has Been Spoiled" indicates the need for renewal in property endeavors.
2. **Changed Lines:** Activity in the Parents line suggests ideal property conditions, while the World line's stillness indicates seizing current opportunities.

<analyze>
- Both examples assess elements and changed lines for relational insights. 
- They focus on how the dynamic between these lines influences the current situation or decision.
- Example interpretations emphasize a balance of opportunity with prudence, drawing attention to timing and relational harmony (through Six Relatives and line transformation).
</analyze>

### Interaction and Reasoning

<reason>
Let's employ similar methodologies to analyze your hexagram for the question: "Can the certain investment in item be made?"

1. **Primary Hexagram "Duration (Heng):** 
   - **Endurance and Firmness:** Suggest that the investment itself demands a commitment and a steady, deliberate approach. Success will come through continuous effort and adherence to righteous motives.
  
2. **Elemental and Relational Interaction:**
   - Line 1 emphasizes caution against diving too deep too quickly, yet the change (Initial Nine) encourages engaging with opportunities as they come, learning from experiences.
   - Line 2's changes suggest the presence of danger followed by equilibrium. Consider sudden risks but expect to find balance afterward.
   - Line 3 warns against inadequacy in sustaining one's path, but indicates clarity will come. A potential moment of uncertainty in investment could resolve favorably.
   - Lines 4 to 6 do not show transformative changes. They highlight the need for staying away from unsuitable ventures and maintaining prudence rather than seeking what's not appropriate (demonstrated by "nothing caught in the hunt" and "perpetual motion").

3. **Interactions with Five Elements and Six Relatives:** 
   - The key elements reflect potential disturbances (fire and water interplay); consider these when viewing prospects and market changes.
   - "Wife and Wealth" indicate investment potential. Any disturbance, as seen in Line 3, could obstruct financial continuity, but resolution seems available.

4. **Final Assessment:**
   - The hexagram and additional contexts suggest potential for investment given careful scrutiny and strategic engagement, yet highlight fitness and timing. Firm yet adaptable approaches should ensure successful future continuity.
</reason>

Before making any decisions, evaluate current circumstances, adjust comprehension to any fresh insights, and balance between perseverance (as encouraged by Duration) and adaptability (suggested by line changes). This method ensures one aligns actions with gains worthy of the long-term commitment emphasized by the hexagram Duration.
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram of "Duration" suggests that your investment in the item can be made successfully, provided you exercise patience and perseverance. This hexagram focuses on maintaining a steadfast approach and emphasizing a consistent path. However, avoid rushing or making impulsive decisions; instead, allow time to shape your endeavors. Consider the long-term benefits and continue with a determined and careful strategy to ensure that your investment aligns with enduring success.

TERMINATE
Standard Answer: The line representing the self moves and transforms into wealth, is regenerated and combined. The wealth is nourished by the day, making it possible to seek profit, but it is empty, indicating that immediate benefits are not seen. The hexagram changes to the six clashes, which indicates it will not be permanent. Overall, it appears beneficial, but the benefit is not great.
