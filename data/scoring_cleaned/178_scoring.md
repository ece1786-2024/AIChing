To evaluate the generated answer compared to the standard answer, let's first break down the standard answer into key points:

1. Negative Outcome/Expectation - "It won't work out."
   - This is the central theme of the standard answer, emphasizing a negative prediction. Full Score: 8

Now, evaluate the generated answer based on these aspects:

1. **Negative Outcome/Expectation**: The generated answer mentions a likely positive outcome, which is the opposite of "It won't work out." This suggests an improper understanding of the standard answer's expectation. Score: 0

2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is generally related to the question since it discusses the prediction of the success of a romantic pursuit and Chinese hexagrams, matching the context of fortune-telling. Score: 2

Let's put the evaluation into a CSV table wrapped with HTML labels:
