1. **Obtained the help of siblings, but within the hexagram, it is restricted**: This is a crucial point as it sets the context of potential assistance from siblings but indicates limitations. It suggests reliance on external help (siblings), which might not be beneficial.

2. **No wealth can be earned**: This key point underscores the futility of the efforts, despite apparent resources or help being available.

3. **Resulting in busy efforts for nothing**: This highlights that efforts will be exerted without any tangible rewards. It's the culmination of the analysis, emphasizing the fruitlessness of the situation.

Now, let's evaluate the generated answer:

1. **Obtained the help of siblings, but within the hexagram, it is restricted**: The generated answer refers to "partnering with your cousin" which loosely corresponds to gaining help (siblings). However, it does not address the restriction aspect. I'd assign 1 out of 2 for recognizing partnership but missing the limitation detail.

2. **No wealth can be earned**: The generated answer suggests "potential for profit" instead of the standard's "no wealth." This contradicts the standard answer. Thus, it gets 0 for this key point.

3. **Resulting in busy efforts for nothing**: The response advises caution and preparation for success, which contrasts the idea of 'efforts leading to nothing'. It implies possible success rather than certain failure. Hence, 0 score here.

Relevance will be rated as it relates to efforts towards a financial goal.
