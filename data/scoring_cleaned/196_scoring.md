Certainly! Let's break down the standard answer into key points and evaluate the generated answer:

### Key Points from the Standard Answer:
1. **Cannot be accomplished (3 points):** This refers to the notion that the endeavor in question is not going to be successful, implying a finality in the possibility of achieving the goal.
   
2. **No adverse effects on sibling (5 points):** This highlights that although the goal cannot be accomplished, there will be no negative repercussions or harm to the sibling involved. This is the main emphasis in the standard answer.

### Evaluation of the Generated Answer:
- **Relevance (2 points):** The generated answer indicates a careful and methodical approach towards a business venture with a sibling, providing advice on how to approach matters with mutual respect and communication. While it doesn't capture the exact sentiment of failure suggested by the standard answer, it stays relevant as it addresses a business endeavor among siblings.

- **Cannot be accomplished:** The generated answer suggests that there is potential for success, which contradicts the "cannot be accomplished" sentiment of the standard answer. Thus, this key point is not covered, receiving a score of **0 points**.

- **No adverse effects on sibling:** Although the generated answer does not directly address the lack of adverse effects noted in the standard answer, it emphasizes mutual respect and leveraging family support, implying that the relationship will remain harmonious. Therefore, it partially covers the sentiment and receives a score of **2 points**.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Cannot be accomplished:** The generated answer actually speaks about the potential for success and therefore completely misses the mark on this key point.
   
2. **No adverse effects on sibling:** The generated answer implicitly guarantees a positive relationship throughout the business endeavor, which somewhat correlates with "no adverse effects on sibling," albeit more implicitly than explicitly.
