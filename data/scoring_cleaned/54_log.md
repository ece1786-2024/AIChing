## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Possession in Great Measure

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Great Possession: Prosperous and Unimpeded.		
		
The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.		
		
Fame: Some reputation has been gained, but do not become complacent and stagnant. Avoid indulging in worldly affairs, and continue striving upward with the help of true friends to reach new heights.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: With superior conditions, many choices are available, so it is best to proceed cautiously. Efforts should be made to maintain the family for both parties.		
		
Decision-Making: With a strong personality, courageous in overcoming difficulties, striving for progress. Numerous challenges and misfortunes arise on the path forward, and only by taking them seriously can continual success be achieved. If vigilance is relaxed, arrogance and complacency will lead to disastrous failure. Many friends and extensive social interactions can greatly aid the career, though there may also be malicious individuals attempting to undermine.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun is bright in the sky, shining upon all things; it is magnificent and prosperous, maintaining abundance and stability. Those who receive this hexagram are enjoying good fortune, with everything auspicious and great harvests, but they should be wary of the principle that extremes lead to reversal, and that at the peak of prosperity, decline may follow. 		
		
Fortunes: Unparalleled smoothness and outstanding brilliance.  		
Wealth: Proceed boldly, and wealth will come naturally.  		
Family: A household that accumulates good deeds, with descendants preserving it.  		
Health: Rising false fire, be careful with treatment.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Innocence

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Wu Wang: Favorable and unobstructed, divination reveals auspicious signs. If actions are improper, there will be misfortune and harm, and endeavors will be unfavorable. 		
		
The "Image" commentary says: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, while the lower trigram is Zhen, representing Thunder. Beneath the heavens, the spring thunder rolls, all things sprout and flourish, multiplying and reproducing — this is the image of Wu Wang. The ancient kings observed this hexagram, thereby inspiring themselves to strive with diligence, comply with the seasons, and nurture all things.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram involves the overlay of different trigrams: Zhen below and Qian above. Qian represents the heavens, firmness, and vigor; Zhen stands for thunder, firmness, and movement. When movement is vigorous, firm, and positive, the spirit is uplifted, leading inevitably to attainment, but only by following the path of purity and truth. Without falsehood, success will come, and blessings will follow.		
		
The Great Image: Thunder moves in the sky, and the masculine energy spreads out, symbolizing truthfulness without falseness.		
		
Fortune: In all pursuits, it is advisable to maintain integrity. Those whose actions lack proper conduct will surely invite disaster.		
		
Career: It is valuable to have self-awareness and to start from one's actual circumstances without harboring unrealistic expectations. By being grounded, diligent, and careful in one's conduct, unexpected misfortunes can be avoided. Focus on the process rather than the outcome, pursue sincerely, act when the timing is right, and success in one's career will follow.		
		
Business: Avoid forcing things that are difficult. Adhere to market rules, uphold business ethics, avoid speculative mentality, and reject the pursuit of excessive profits. Through hard work and gradual accumulation, success is assured.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With good motivations and diligent effort, discard illusions, focus on the labor rather than the harvest, and inevitably there will be gains.		
		
Marriage and Love: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity, and must not take a hasty attitude. It is also inappropriate to rush into anything; let things develop naturally—a culmination will be reached when conditions are ripe.		
		
Decision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Do not deceive, do not speak falsely, be genuine and sincere; conform to nature, and blessings and prosperity will be profound and extensive. Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home's fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family. Health: Maintain exercise, and digestion will occur naturally.
