To evaluate the generated answer based on the standard answer, we first need to break down the standard answer into key points, assigning scores to each point based on their importance.

1. **Relationship is strained (4 points):** 
    - Importance: High. The core issue in the standard answer is capturing the state of the couple's relationship, described as "strained."
2. **Wife's appearance is average (2 points):** 
    - Importance: Medium. It's a specific detail mentioned in the standard answer, related to the wife's characteristic, but not as crucial as the relationship status.
3. **Wife's work ability is not strong (2 points):**
    - Importance: Medium. Similar to the point about appearance, this pertains to another characteristic of the wife. 

Now, let's evaluate the relevance of the generated answer to the question:

- **Relevance (2 points):** 
  - The generated answer discusses strategic retreat, harmony, and the stability of family dynamics, but does not directly address the strained relationship or the specific attributes of the wife mentioned in the standard answer.

Next, evaluate the generated answer to see how many of these key points are covered:

1. **Relationship is strained:**
   - The generated answer implies challenges within the family, which can loosely be linked to the "strained relationship." However, it is not addressed directly or explicitly. 
   - Score: 1 out of 4.

2. **Wife's appearance is average:**
   - The generated answer does not allude to any physical characteristics of individuals within the family unit.
   - Score: 0 out of 2.

3. **Wife's work ability is not strong:**
   - The generated answer does not mention the wife's work ability or any individual capabilities.
   - Score: 0 out of 2.

Let's summarize this evaluation in a CSV table format:
