## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Biting Through

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Shi He: It signifies smoothness and favorability in legal matters.		
		
The commentary explains: In this hexagram, the lower trigram Zhen represents thunder, and the upper trigram Li represents lightning. The combination of thunder and lightning forms the image of Shi He. The ancient kings observed this hexagram and took inspiration from the majestic thunder and the illuminating lightning. They aimed to govern with stern clarity, thereby understanding and rectifying their penalties and laws.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is an overlapping of different trigrams (Zhen below and Li above). Li represents the yin hexagram; Zhen represents the yang hexagram. The intermingling of yin and yang crushes hard objects, symbolizing the application of both grace and authority, the combination of leniency and strictness, and the integration of firmness and gentleness. Shi Ke refers to the closing of the upper and lower jaws and chewing.		
		
The Great Image: There is something between the upper and lower lips that must be bitten through to achieve closure, indicating that obstacles hinder all tasks. It is essential to remove them in order to succeed.		
		
Fortune: Obstacles are present in all matters, and disputes are inevitable. It is advisable to adhere to routines and not be drawn by temptations. Problems can be resolved.

Listen carefully to counsel, adhere to the law, act impartially, do not show favoritism, and be especially cautious not to violate criminal laws.		
		
Fame Seeking: Your efforts are not yet recognized by others. Do not rush for quick success. Treat setbacks as personal tests. Persevere, and you will certainly succeed.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Initially not smooth, but with tenacity, a satisfactory outcome can be achieved. Do not let personal emotions dictate family matters.		
		
Decision-Making: Life is not smooth; you will encounter setbacks and difficulties, but you should view them as personal tests. Summarize experiences and lessons seriously, with a stronger will, remain unyielding and continue forward. Through tempering, there will be significant progress in all aspects, ultimately reaching a bright realm and achieving great success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Biting through hard bones, a tough attitude; many obstacles, actively seeking solutions. Those who receive this hexagram will find things not going as desired, disputes are inevitable, and all matters face obstacles. It is advisable to adhere to usual practices, not be lured by profit, to ensure safety.		
		
Fu Pei-rong, a renowned scholar of Taiwanese classical studies, explains:

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Gathering Together

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Cui: Prosperity. The king arrives at the ancestral temple to conduct sacrifices. Receiving this hexagram through divination is beneficial for meeting noblemen and dukes; it signifies openness and smoothness. This is an auspicious and favorable omen. Offering oxen for sacrifice is also very auspicious, and traveling is favorable.		
		
The Image Commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Dui, which symbolizes marsh; the lower trigram is Kun, which symbolizes earth. Marsh water flooding the land is the image of the Cui hexagram. The junzi, observing this hexagram image, takes heed of rampant floodwaters and the gathering of troubles, thereby maintaining and preparing arms, staying vigilant against unexpected disturbances.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacked (with Earth below and Lake above). Earth signifies ground and compliance; Lake signifies marsh and water. As the marsh overflows and inundates the earth, competition among people becomes frequent, posing pervasive threats. It is crucial to follow the divine order and employ virtuous people, preparing in advance, being gentle yet cheerful, mutually enhancing each other for harmonious living and stability. Cui symbolizes gathering and unity.		
		
Image: With the marsh on the earth, water accumulates in the soil, nourishing plants, leading to luxuriant growth.		
		
Fortune: Prosperity is abundant, and with the support of elders, one can achieve great career success, but financial disputes must be cautiously avoided.		
		
Career: Flourishing and thriving, with harmony and unity. Although progressing well, excessive water symbolizes fierce competition among people. As prosperity inevitably declines, it is wise to avoid arrogance, maintain diligence and caution. However, indecision is not advisable; one should forge ahead boldly, exploring new ventures. It is essential to command respect through noble virtues.		
		
Business: Sincere cooperation and mutual assistance. Encouragement is the hallmark of thriving business. Boldly explore the market, advance prudently, and be well-prepared to ensure continual development.		
		
Seeking Reputation: Solely relying on personal effort yields limited achievements; assistance from others is necessary, combined with personal attributes, to reach the desired goal.
- Scholar Interpretation: Abundance in resources leads to great gathering and prosperity; gaining the assistance of noble guides, nothing will go amiss. For those who receive this hexagram, fortune is highly favorable. They can receive help from influential people, gain significant profits, and nothing will be disadvantageous. 		
		
Analysis by the Taiwanese Confucian scholar Fu Pei-Rong:		
Fortune: Stay cautious even in safety, and you can remain free from worries.		
Wealth: The image of accumulating wealth suggests cycles of gathering and dispersing.		
Home: Guard against water entering the house; maintain self-discipline and integrity.		
Health: Swelling in the chest and abdomen, take early measures to adjust.

### Line Information

- Line 1
    - Description: Initial Six: Captured prisoners, yet they escaped, causing disorder and anxiety, and people are shouting while pursuing them all around. Finally recaptured, there is joy and laughter, no need to worry anymore. Drawing this line, boldly proceed, there is no disaster.

- Line 3
    - Description: Line three: Worry and lament. Obtaining this line in divination is of no benefit. There are no disasters in travel, but there are minor troubles.

    - Element: yi mao wood, Relation: Wife and Wealth, 
    - Spirit: Flying Serpent
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the Third Place: Being entangled and unable to decisively retreat is like suffering from a severe illness, placing one in danger. In such a situation, maintaining servants may be beneficial.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The danger caused by being entangled and unable to decisively retreat is likened to being exhausted by illness. Therefore, it is said that maintaining servants is auspicious, meaning one should temporarily nurture oneself and heal, avoiding hasty actions.
        - Element: bing shen gold, Relation: Sibling

- Line 4
    - Description: Nine in the fourth place: Great good fortune and no disaster.		
		
The commentary on the image states: The divination symbol is inherently one of great good fortune, but the outcome is merely the absence of disaster. This is because the fourth nine is a yang line occupying a yin position, resembling someone of minor virtue and ability in a high position. In terms of career advancement, it signifies smooth progression, but when it comes to holding office, all that can be sought is the absence of misfortune.
    - Element: ding hai water, Relation: Children, 
    - Spirit: White Tiger
    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Six: Sighing and weeping, full of worry and anxiety, yet there is no disaster.

    - Element: ding wei soil, Relation: Parents, 
    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Top Nine: Soaring high and retreating into the mountains and forests, there is nothing unfavorable.  		
The "Xiang Ci" says:
        - Element: ren xu soil, Relation: Parents

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Parents line is thriving and moving, indicating that the conditions for renovation are mature. The self line is still and transforms into decline, suggesting the need to control the budget to ensure the quality of the renovation.

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram of Great Possession: Prosperous and Unimpeded.		
		
The Image text says: The lower trigram of this hexagram is Qian, which represents Heaven, and the upper trigram is Li, which represents Fire. Fire is above the sky, illuminating all directions, which is the image of Great Possession. The noble person, observing this hexagram, takes a cue from the fire, discerning good and evil, suppresses evil, promotes good, and thus complies with the mandate of Heaven, praying for the acquisition of good fortune.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams (below Qian, above Li). The upper trigram is Li, representing fire; the lower trigram is Qian, representing heaven. Fire is on the heavens, illuminating all things, with all people submitting, adhering to heavenly timing, resulting in great achievements.		
		
The Image: The sun is in the sky, shining over all things on earth, yet there are five Yangs competing with one Yin, implying one must understand that fullness leads to deficiency.		
		
Fortune: Prosperous and greatly auspicious with favorable timing and opportunity, but beware of the reversal of fortune when things reach extremes.		
		
Career: Achievements in the career field have been made, yet one must avoid complacency and reckless behavior. It is crucial to stop evil and promote virtue, maintain impartiality and integrity, associate with honest friends, be cautious and diligent, to truly achieve greatness without arrogance, and fullness without overflow, moving the career to a higher level.		
		
Business: Thriving and prosperous, having overcome difficult times, entering a booming stage. By restraining the urge for wealth, adhering to the principle of honesty and fairness, working diligently and frugally, and especially by continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting accordingly, long-term sustenance is possible.		
		
Fame: Some reputation has been gained, but do not become complacent and stagnant. Avoid indulging in worldly affairs, and continue striving upward with the help of true friends to reach new heights.		
		
Marriage and Relationships: With superior conditions, many choices are available, so it is best to proceed cautiously. Efforts should be made to maintain the family for both parties.		
		
Decision-Making: With a strong personality, courageous in overcoming difficulties, striving for progress. Numerous challenges and misfortunes arise on the path forward, and only by taking them seriously can continual success be achieved. If vigilance is relaxed, arrogance and complacency will lead to disastrous failure. Many friends and extensive social interactions can greatly aid the career, though there may also be malicious individuals attempting to undermine.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun is bright in the sky, shining upon all things; it is magnificent and prosperous, maintaining abundance and stability. Those who receive this hexagram are enjoying good fortune, with everything auspicious and great harvests, but they should be wary of the principle that extremes lead to reversal, and that at the peak of prosperity, decline may follow.
