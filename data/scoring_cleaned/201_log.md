## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Innocence

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Wu Wang: Favorable and unobstructed, divination reveals auspicious signs. If actions are improper, there will be misfortune and harm, and endeavors will be unfavorable. 		
		
The "Image" commentary says: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Qian, representing Heaven, while the lower trigram is Zhen, representing Thunder. Beneath the heavens, the spring thunder rolls, all things sprout and flourish, multiplying and reproducing â€” this is the image of Wu Wang. The ancient kings observed this hexagram, thereby inspiring themselves to strive with diligence, comply with the seasons, and nurture all things.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram involves the overlay of different trigrams: Zhen below and Qian above. Qian represents the heavens, firmness, and vigor; Zhen stands for thunder, firmness, and movement. When movement is vigorous, firm, and positive, the spirit is uplifted, leading inevitably to attainment, but only by following the path of purity and truth. Without falsehood, success will come, and blessings will follow.		
		
The Great Image: Thunder moves in the sky, and the masculine energy spreads out, symbolizing truthfulness without falseness.		
		
Fortune: In all pursuits, it is advisable to maintain integrity. Those whose actions lack proper conduct will surely invite disaster.		
		
Career: It is valuable to have self-awareness and to start from one's actual circumstances without harboring unrealistic expectations. By being grounded, diligent, and careful in one's conduct, unexpected misfortunes can be avoided. Focus on the process rather than the outcome, pursue sincerely, act when the timing is right, and success in one's career will follow.		
		
Business: Avoid forcing things that are difficult. Adhere to market rules, uphold business ethics, avoid speculative mentality, and reject the pursuit of excessive profits. Through hard work and gradual accumulation, success is assured.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: With good motivations and diligent effort, discard illusions, focus on the labor rather than the harvest, and inevitably there will be gains.		
		
Marriage and Love: Both parties should treat each other with sincerity, and must not take a hasty attitude. It is also inappropriate to rush into anything; let things develop naturallyâ€”a culmination will be reached when conditions are ripe.		
		
Decision-Making: With abundant energy and ambition, achievements can be made. However, one must be diligent and earnest, striving and studying tenaciously. Do not become complacent over small achievements. Rather than pursuing outcomes, focus on action. Follow proper procedures, act when opportunities arise, and above all, eliminate unrealistic ideas. In this way, one can realize their ideals.
- Scholar Interpretation: Do not deceive, do not speak falsely, be genuine and sincere; conform to nature, and blessings and prosperity will be profound and extensive. Those who receive this hexagram and follow the natural course, remaining upright and adhering to the right path, will find all matters favorable. However, those whose actions are improper will surely invite disaster. Fu Peirong, the great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets: Fortune: At the peak of good fortune, all matters are suitable. Wealth: When goods arrive, wealth comes naturally, bringing happiness. Home: The home's fortune is very prosperous; a perfect match for the family. Health: Maintain exercise, and digestion will occur naturally.

## Primary Hexagram: Difficulty at the Beginning

The Commentary on the Image states: The upper trigram of Tun is Kan, representing clouds, and the lower trigram is Zhen, representing thunder. Clouds move above, and thunder moves below, forming the image of the hexagram Tun. The noble person observes this hexagram's image and emulates the qualities of clouds and thunder, using the grace of clouds and the majesty of thunder to govern state affairs.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is formed by the superimposition of different trigrams (Zhen below, Kan above). Zhen represents thunder, symbolizing movement; Kan represents rain, symbolizing danger. The combination of thunder and rain indicates a tumultuous and perilous situation with a harsh environment. Originally, "Tun" referred to the sprouting of plants on earth, the beginning of all things, full of difficulties and obstacles. However, if one goes with the times and responds appropriately, prosperity is inevitable.		
		
Great Image: "Tun" signifies difficulty, as everything is attempting to proceed but cannot advance.

Hence, one should frequently offer favors in ordinary times.		
		
Business: At the start of an enterprise, the path is difficult with many setbacks. Firm belief is most important.

If difficulties persist, it is advised to retreat and safeguard, awaiting the opportunity for future plans.

    - Spirit: White Tiger

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the Third Place: In chasing the wild deer, there is no official serving as a guide. Reflecting on it, the deer escape into the mountains and forests.

**Here's my question: Can partnering with my cousin to sell lottery tickets make money?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's start by analyzing the Hexagram "Difficulty at the Beginning" given for your situation. By breaking down the components and drawing conclusions as was demonstrated in the provided examples, we can discern the potential outcome for partnering with your cousin in selling lottery tickets.

### Hexagram Analysis

#### Symbolism and Attributes
- **Primary Hexagram: Difficulty at the Beginning** (`Tun`)
  - This hexagram embodies initial challenges and mixed fortunes akin to the start of any venture. It represents the difficulty associated with beginnings, but also potential for growth if handled with careful consideration.
  
#### Meaning and Interpretation
- **General Information**: The hexagram "Difficulty at the Beginning" stresses the importance of cautious progress and readiness in the face of adversities. It suggests that the situation is delicate early on and requires extra effort and strategic planning to move past initial hurdles. The encouragement is to face obstacles with perseverance and wise decision-making. The advice given to not venture out too quickly is crucial in maintaining stability and leveraging the current environment wisely.

- **Occupational Insight**: Related to business prospects, this hexagram indicates an opportunity for profit hidden amidst hardship. The venture isn't initially straightforward but is potentially rewarding. Building a strong foundation and being flexible with challenges could eventually lead to success. However, it warns against rushed actions and advises on meticulous planning and readiness to adapt.

### Line Information

- **Line 1 Analysis**
  - **Description and Interaction**: The transition from Nine to Six in the first line indicates the presence of potential challenges and the need for cautious and considered decision-making when setting foundations. It carries a sense of prudent retreat when facing unexpected trouble.
  
- **Line 2 Analysis**
  - **Potential Challenges**: With the spirit of the White Tiger, it hints at unexpected challenges or resistance. It signals a difficulty in proceeding with plans, though it downplays abrupt actions in favor of incremental ones.
  
- **Line 3 Analysis**
  - **Adversity Noted**: The pursuit without guidance symbolizes a possible misdirection in endeavors if no cautious manoeuvring is attempted. It implies possible abandonment of the venture if tangible results do not manifest quickly.
  
- **Line 4 Analysis**
  - **Insight into Strategy**: Suggests strategic partnerships or alliances are beneficial, but only with clear intentions and planned actions.
  
- **Line 5 and 6**
  - Suggests a reevaluation of priorities and anticipates hardships or stagnation without suitable intervention.

### Interaction: Elements, Relatives, and Spirits
- Considering the **Five Elements** interactions in this scenario, the dominance of Water and Soil indicates the dynamic between nurturing growth (Water) while overcoming obstacles (Soil). The progression signifies navigating through unknown waters and the necessary nurturing actions required for stable beginnings.
- **Six Relatives** and **Six Spirits** focus on mutual support and diligence, embodying patience and tenacity required in the nascent stages of a joint financial venture.

<analyze>
Let's analyze step by step on how the example analysis might have drawn insights:

1. **Hexagram Analysis**: Both examples focus on deconstructing the interaction between the primary and changing lines, along with corresponding spirits. The emphasis is placed on how the elements and thematic conflicts (like adversity overcoming prosperity or difficulties in earnest collaboration) influence the current and future state of affairs.
   
2. **Elemental Interactions**: In these examples, each element's influence (Wood, Water, Earth, Gold) is linked extensively with "Relation" attributes such as Demons or Wife and Wealth, illustrating where support or resistance lies. 

3. **Line Changes and Spirits**: Both examples reviewed the lines' changed positions, casting implications of growth, blockage, or favorable yin/yang dynamics. They highlight how a potential outcome requires not merely an understanding of the initial hexagram but how modified qualities can adjust the interpretation.
</analyze>

<reason>
In the case of selling lottery tickets with your cousin, the interpretive lines call for sensible executionâ€”cautious, strategic advancement through adversities symbolized by the "Difficulty at the Beginning" hexagram. Enterprisingly, the venture can blossom if met with foresight and patience at elemental and relational levels; yet, the immediate obstacles signal refrained approachâ€”even retreat or reconsiderationâ€”until one achieves a steady foothold within this partnership.

Breaking down the initial hesitance and obstacles given by the Primary Hexagram, additional patience preparing this venture with your cousin is implicit given the evident difficulties infused within the hexagram analysis and transitioning dynamics.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Partnering with your cousin to sell lottery tickets poses initial challenges, as suggested by the Hexagram "Difficulty at the Beginning." It indicates that while there may be potential for profit, the venture will face early hurdles requiring careful and strategic planning. Success is possible, but it will demand perseverance, flexibility, and readiness to adapt to changing situations. Consider proceeding cautiously, ensuring you lay a strong foundation before expanding or committing heavily.
