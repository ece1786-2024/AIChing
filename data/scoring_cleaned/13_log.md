## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: The Power of the Great

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Da Zhuang: A favorable divination.  		
The Xiang commentary states: The upper trigram of this hexagram is Zhen, which represents thunder, and the lower trigram is Qian, which represents heaven. Thunder resounding in the sky is the image of Da Zhuang. A noble person observes this image, recognizing the formidable speed of thunder and the strictness of propriety. Consequently, they have awe and respect, adhering solely to propriety.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (Qian below and Zhen above). Zhen signifies thunder; Qian signifies heaven. Qian is strong and Zhen moves. The sky roars with thunder, clouds roll, and the momentum is grand. Yang energy is abundant, and all things grow. The strength is robust, hence it is called powerful. Large and powerful, thus it is named Great Power. The four yang lines are vigorous, proactive, and effective. Both the upper and lower are just, with correct standards and upright shadows.		
		
Image: The sound of thunder is loud, echoing through the sky, representing an image of utmost integrity and brightness, and also a strong seismic image, being one of the six conflict hexagrams.		
		
Fortune: Although fortune is strong, it has reached its peak. It is advisable to maintain peace of mind; otherwise, it will lead to failure. One must remember that things reverse when they reach the extreme.		
		
Career: In dealing with the world, rely on wisdom, not strength. Have courage and also strategy, and avoid reckless actions. If you should keep yourself in place, do not move recklessly to avoid disaster. Do not overreach, or you will encounter danger. Be cautious of vile people and never underestimate their treachery. Courageously advance in your career, but avoid impulsiveness.		
		
Business: In a period of boom, the situation is favorable. However, do not overreach, nor act rashly. Actively enhance cooperation with others. Stay alert and understand the principle that things reverse when they reach the extreme. Prepare for a downturn in business.		
		
Fame: Be sure to wisely harness your power and do not rely on your strength to advance rashly, especially not with arrogance. Properly utilize your talents, along with external assistance, to surely achieve something.		
		
Marriage: Never be arrogant due to your own favorable conditions. Do not miss a good marriage opportunity.		
		
Decision-making: Maintain appropriate strength and do not overly exhaust yourself. When things go smoothly in your career, particularly avoid acting rashly. Pay special attention, as you may already be in a dilemma, and must preserve yourself while waiting for an opportunity, preparing for an early move.
- Scholar Interpretation: Be upright and magnanimous, strong and robust; be tolerant and amiable, and avoid impulsiveness at all costs. For those who receive this hexagram, the fortune is excessively strong. It is advisable to remain calm and act cautiously; otherwise, mistakes are inevitable. Explanation by the eminent Taiwanese scholar Fu Peirong: 		
		
Timing: Achieving fame is not difficult, but do not be arrogant. 		
Wealth: Sell at a fair price, do not be overly greedy. 		
Home: Take care to prevent fires; treat each other with respect as guests. 		
Health: Take care of your feet.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Increase

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Yi: Encountering this line during divination is advantageous for going forward, beneficial for crossing rivers and wading through waters.		
		
The Explanation of the Image states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Xun, which symbolizes wind; the lower trigram is Zhen, which symbolizes thunder. The interaction of wind and thunder creates the image of the Yi hexagram. When a noble person observes this hexagram, they are awed by the power of wind and thunder, and thus, upon seeing goodness, they follow it; upon realizing their mistakes, they amend them.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of two different trigrams (Thunder below, Wind above). Wind signifies movement; Thunder signifies intensity. The interaction between Wind and Thunder escalates its strength, making the thunder louder. Wind and Thunder assist each other and grow together, mutually benefiting one another. This hexagram is the opposite of the Decrease hexagram. It signifies decreasing above to increase below, whereas the latter signifies decreasing below to increase above. Both hexagrams explain the principles of loss and gain.		
		
The Great Image: It represents the image of strong winds accompanied by rapid thunder, indicating the growth of power and influence. The union of the eldest son and daughter symbolizes the union of husband and wife, bringing prosperity to descendants.		
		
Fortune: At present, it is an auspicious time, aided by influential people, leading to success. It is beneficial to be generous to others, as giving is more fortunate than receiving.		
		
Career: Boldly invest and support others' businesses for mutual benefits. Advance courageously, and take decisive actions. As long as one is kind-hearted, pure, and humble, the career will undoubtedly grow daily, with unlimited prospects. Help others promptly and be proactive in emergencies. In developing a career, internal unity, public support, perseverance, and a fearless approach to challenges are essential.		
		
Business: Avoid pursuing small gains; granting benefits to customers will result in substantial profits. Avoid insatiable greed! During risks, seek advice from others and strive for sincere assistance.		
		
Reputation: Sincerely help others, and you will certainly receive sincere reciprocation and support, leading to successful endeavors.		
		
Marriage and Love: Harmonious and loving relationships are predestined.		
		
Decision-making: Be open-minded and willing to help others. Cultivate good interpersonal relationships and gain widespread support. It is essential to establish perseverance and overcome indecisiveness. Especially learn from those better than yourself, leveraging their strength to enrich and develop oneself. Foster a necessary spirit of adventure. Regularly do good for others. Hence, even in danger, one will receive help from others.
- Scholar Interpretation: Decrease above and increase below, strive forward vigorously; endeavor and achieve fame, merchants gain profit. Those who obtain this hexagram are in the midst of good fortune, energetically pursue progress, receive help from others, and can achieve fame and profit. Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese national studies, interprets:		
		
Fortune: A time of satisfaction, replacing the old with the new.  		
Wealth: Trade must be swift to be profitable.  		
Home: Be cautious of wind and thunder; marriage is harmonious.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Grace

### General Information

- Description: The Pi Hexagram: Success. There is small gain in proceeding somewhere.  		
  		
The "Image" commentary says: In the original hexagram, the upper trigram is Gen, symbolizing the mountain, and the lower trigram is Li, symbolizing fire. With fire beneath the mountain, the fire sweeps through the hills. This is the hexagram image of Pi. A gentleman observing this hexagram reflects on the image of fierce fire enveloping the mountain, where both jade and stone are consumed, and all vegetation is destroyed. He takes this as a warning, thereby ensuring clarity in all governmental affairs, and refrains from making judgments with severity.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of different trigrams (below is Li and above is Gen). Li symbolizes fire and brightness; Gen symbolizes the mountain and stopping. It signifies enlightenment with restraint. The Bi hexagram discusses the relationship between culture and substance, with a focus on substance, adjusted through culture. Bi means adornment and embellishment.		
		
Great Image: The sun sets in the west, illuminating with clarity, radiating magnificence and splendor, while it also metaphorically suggests the diminishing of luminous power and the expansion of dark forces.		
		
Fortune: The appearance is splendid, but there is emptiness within. It is necessary to enrich oneself, and all matters should be approached steadily and systematically.		
		
Career: Things are going smoothly with minor achievements. It is advisable to promptly summarize experiences and plan for greater development. Build confidence and do not focus on temporary gains or losses. Pursue substantial content and act prudently; do not follow the crowd, seek powerful people to support you.		
		
Business: Initially, you will encounter difficulties. Do not despair; instead, thoroughly analyze the situation, expand boldly, and invest courageously. Collaborate with others and jointly cooperate, operating business based on the market.		
		
Reputation: Do not overly focus on appearance; instead, emphasize inner qualities. Boldly promote yourself, but hold onto your ideals.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Choose carefully. If someone suitable appears, pursue earnestly without hesitation or indecision. Focus on the inner qualities of the other person and do not be deceived by outward appearances.		
		
Decision-Making: There is a tendency to focus on appearance while lacking perseverance in pursuing inner qualities. The disposition is rather restless, overly concerned with vain reputation, often leading to setbacks or abandonment halfway. With the education of facts, change impractical practices, discern society and life clearly, becoming more restrained and self-possessed, emphasizing self-cultivation to complete the career. Significant achievements will be possible after reaching middle age, and in old age, one can continue to exert influence.
- Scholar Interpretation: Adorned with brightness externally, but needing support internally; during times of hidden troubles, act according to one's capabilities. Those who receive this hexagram appear to be glorious on the surface, but are internally hollow, with more illusion than reality. It is advisable to enrich oneself, act prudently, and act within one's capabilities. Interpretation by Taiwan's esteemed Confucian scholar Fu Peirong: Timing and fortune: There is resistance above, do not act arbitrarily. Wealth: Be shrewd in management, beware of being trapped. Home: Be cautious of fire hazards. Health: Rising pent-up heat, be cautious with cold remedies.

### Line Information

    - Description: In the first nine, wearing flower-decorated shoes, one refrains from getting on the carriage, choosing to walk on foot.

    - Spirit: Azure Dragon
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:

The Image Commentary says: The mischievous children encounter danger, but because parents rebuke and restrain them, accidents are unlikely to occur.
        - Element: bing chen soil, Relation: Sibling

    - Shi/Ying Line: Shi
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the fifth place: The wild goose stops on the hill. For one who receives this line in divination, it indicates that the wife has been unable to conceive for many years, but she will never be replaced by another, which is auspicious.  		
The Commentary on the Symbol says: Never being replaced by another is auspicious, as the wife fulfills the wish to live in harmony with her husband until old age.
        - Element: xin si fire, Relation: Parents

- Line 6
    - Description: Top Nine: Offering white silk adorned with multicolored patterns, no misfortune will occur.

**Here's my question: When will financial gain be realized?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step how the example interpretations are derived using the provided hexagram information.

<analyze>

**Example 1: Will there be a breakthrough in financial fortune in the coming year?**

1. **Hexagram Identification:** The primary hexagram is "The Power of the Great" (Da Zhuang). This indicates a strong and powerful energy, represented by the combination of thunder and heaven. The descriptions point to abundant yang energy, suggesting a peak in fortune. 

2. **Fortune & Career Indications:** There is a caution about not overreaching since fortune has reached its peak. This corresponds with the guidance of maintaining peace to prevent reversal. All these aspects already hint at some form of breakthrough, albeit with a warning about self-control and the need for strategic caution.

3. **Line Analysis:**
    - **Active Lines:** Analyzing whether the changing lines confirm the narrative - for instance, Line 2 transforms to indicate rescue after a difficult situation, suggesting opportunities for recovery.
    - **Six Relatives & Elements:** The interaction such as the presence of the wealth line (Wife and Wealth) being prosperous, along with yang elements interacting in supportive roles signaling opportunity and enthusiasm.

4. **Outcome Assessment:** Although there is strong potential, the transformative nature is the key part of interpreting the financial fortunes – the highlighted wealth line indicates the opportunity. The support line's potency suggests active striving, aligning with the general commentary.

**Example 2: Will the company’s financial situation improve?**

1. **Hexagram Identification:** The hexagram is "Increase" (Yi), with attributes of generosity and mutual assistance. As Increase suggests the gain, the interpretation focuses on optimizing costs and assisting others in business endeavours.

2. **Overall Fortune:** Descriptions of being in auspicious times that allow for collaboration and resource allocation hint at financial improvement.

3. **Line Analysis:** 
    - **Active Lines:** Line actions chiefly relate to the theme of external aid and thoughtful investments – correlating with the optimistic tone of collaboration and mutual benefits.
    - **Six Relatives & Elements:** The wealth and finance focus line is prominent, pointing towards financial relief and progress – illustrating the transformation towards abundance and overcoming financial pressure.

4. **Outcome Assessment:** The resolution hints strongly at growth with informed investment and alliances, aligning with the general theme of aid and shared victory.

</analyze>

<reason>
**Analysis of the user's hexagram:**

1. **Primary Hexagram:** The hexagram is "Grace" (Pi), where the fire (Li) is under the mountain (Gen). This motif projects appearances being grand with an emphasis on refining internal qualities. The descriptors of adjustment through culture suggest enriched understanding and sustenance.

2. **Fortune & Business Narratives:** The hexagram description advises achieving subtle achievements and practical expansions rather than relying on ornate displays of success. It indicates planning and consolidation of experiences for better outcomes.

3. **Line Examination and Dynamics with Six Relatives & Elements:**
    - **Elements and Relations:**
        - **Initial Line Change (Line 1):** Transition points to mischief controlled. The converted sibling element warns of familial distractions addressed promptly.
        - Active line's implication on wealth (Wife and Wealth) in the third line, supported by external figures (Hook Snake), highlights opportunities but hints to affirm relationships.
    - **Six Spirits:** The presence of Black Tortoise at the hexagram’s top hints towards a more circumspect approach in dealings moving forward, reflective of powerful yet restrained progress.

4. **Outcome Impression:** With clear restructuring and a focus on inward development (underscored by "adornment and substance"), financial realizations must materialize with strategic clarity and environmental adjustments. While there is gain awaiting, proactive actions, grounded by self-refinement, dictate the narrative of evolving wealth.

Therefore, while financial gains take form, such manifestation should be anticipated alongside deliberate actions and mindful enrichment, ensuring amplifying intrinsic value over transient allure in preparations towards prosperity.
</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The hexagram "Grace" suggests that financial gains will be realized when you focus on enriching inner qualities and strategic planning, rather than solely relying on outward appearances. This is a time to consolidate your experiences and make practical preparations. Financial success will manifest as you prioritize substance over flashiness and carefully develop your resources.

The timeframe for financial gain is not immediate but will be realized through consistent efforts and mindful adjustments over the coming period. Focus on building solid foundations and nurturing potential partnerships, and the gains will manifest more securely.

Standard Answer: The primary hexagram indicates that seeking wealth involves hardship, suggesting attention should be paid to the Sibling ruling the oracle to avoid signs of dispute. An auspicious omen.
