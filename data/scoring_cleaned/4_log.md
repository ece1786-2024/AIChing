## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Progress

### General Information

- Description: Jin Hexagram: The Marquis of Kang used the fine horses granted by King Cheng for breeding, performing matings multiple times a day. The Commentary on the Image says: "The upper trigram of this hexagram is Li, which represents the sun; the lower trigram is Kun, which represents the earth. The sun shines upon the earth, and all things bathe in its splendor," this is the image of the Jin Hexagram. The superior person observes this image of the hexagram and thus enhances and magnifies their own bright virtue.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of two different trigrams stacked: Kun below and Li above. Li represents the sun and brightness, while Kun symbolizes the earth. The sun hangs high, illuminating the earth. The earth is humble and obedient, enabling all things to grow, implying brilliance, and gentle advances symbolizing a prospering enterprise.		
		
Image: The sun rises above the earth, illuminating it entirely, suggesting progress towards brightness.		
		
Prospects: Career, reputation, and financial luck are all favorable, indicating signs of gaining positions and promotions.		
		
Career: Smooth progress. One should adhere to the right path, face challenges head-on, overcome obstacles, and be guided by the situation. Establish good interpersonal relationships and gain deep trust from people. Strive wholeheartedly without any hesitation or indecision, and avoid being overly cautious, instead persist without discouragement, urging ahead courageously. Pay attention to cooperation and advance together.		
		
Business: The market is favorable, with smooth competition, but some difficulties will also arise. Face challenges head-on, be guided by the situation, overcome obstacles, and strive for public support. Setbacks during progress are inevitable, but with pure motives, crises can be turned into safety.		
		
Pursuit of Fame: Through hard work and struggle, one has laid the foundation for developing a career but may not succeed immediately due to a lack of referrals. Do not become disheartened; patiently wait for an opportunity while proactively creating favorable conditions.		
		
Marriage and Love: Auspicious stars shine. The result will be ideal, but one should not adopt a nonchalant attitude or be overly picky due to perceived superior conditions.		
		
Decision-making: In a continuously rising scenario, there will not be significant resistance. However, it is essential to win trust and hearts of the people, striving even more diligently. As long as motives are pure and one overcomes complacency, happiness will surely befall.
- Scholar Interpretation: The sun rises above the earth, all things progress; rewards are abundant, and all plans achieve success. 		
		
Those who obtain this hexagram are like the rising sun in the east, with strong fortune, substantial income, successful plans, and all matters go smoothly.		
		
Fu Peirong, a great scholar of Taiwanese Sinology, interprets:		
		
Fortune: Good luck approaches, and progress is made step by step.		
		
Wealth: Bright profession, most profitable.		
		
Home: A house full of sunshine.		
		
Health: Self-awareness is key.

        - Element: ji chou soil, Relation: Sibling

- Line 3
    - Description: Nine in the third place: Flat land will eventually turn into sloped land, and those who leave are certain to return.

    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Nine in the fifth place: The gathered multitude first cries out in lamentation and then laughs with joy, because a large force arrives in time to reinforce them, resulting in a great victory.		
		
The Commentary on the Image says: The reason the gathered multitude first cries and then laughs (as the tide of battle turns from defeat to victory) is because this line is encountered in divination, with the nine in the fifth place occupying the central position of the upper trigram. This resembles one who adheres to the path of rectitude and correctness, thus necessarily turning misfortune into fortune. The joining of the large forces signifies that our army has overwhelmed the enemy.

    - Spirit: Flying Serpent
    - Shi/Ying Line: Ying
    - This line has changed. Line information after change:
        - Description: Top Nine: Gathering the masses in the outskirts, offering sacrifices to the spirits to celebrate victory, naturally there is no regret or blame.

        - Element: ren xu soil, Relation: Sibling

## Hexagram Interpretation
  
The Demons line is flourishing and active, generating the self line, indicating that leaders have recognition for the inquirer. The Wife and Wealth line is static and transforms into advancement, showing there is hope for promotion, but patience is required.

## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Stanstill (Stagnation)

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram 12: Stagnation (Pǐ) signifies separation and obstruction caused by petty people. This is unfavorable for the divination of the superior person, indicating a turn from prosperity to decline in affairs. The "Image" commentary states: Heaven and Earth are obstructed and cannot communicate, all things are stifled and cannot thrive; this is the image of the Hexagram of Stagnation. When a superior person observes this hexagram, during times of obstruction in national politics, they should consider retreating into seclusion, valuing frugality to avoid disaster, and not taking pride in wealth and status.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of differing trigrams (Earth below, Heaven above) layered, with a structure opposite to the Tai hexagram. It represents yang energy rising, yin energy descending, Heaven and Earth not communicating, and all things being obstructed. They are mutually "inverse hexagrams," signifying the extremity of Tai leads to Pi, and the extremity of Pi leads to Tai, being causes and effects of each other.		
		
Great Image: Heavenly energy rises, earthly energy descends, the energies of Heaven and Earth do not communicate, resulting in obstruction and impassability.		
		
Fortunes: There is discord between above and below, all endeavors are unsuccessful, it is advisable to be patient and remember that the extreme of obstruction will give way to prosperity.

One should adhere to the righteous path, avoid joining forces with antagonistic people, unite with like-minded individuals, protect oneself, and wait for the opportunity. Maintain confidence, be cautious, and the situation will surely improve, leading to eventual success in one's career.		
		
Business: Encountering strong competitors, finding oneself in an unfavorable position, and suffering significant losses due to lack of information. One must be especially careful and cautious, maintain a defensive stance, and wait for a favorable opportunity to further develop one's business.		
		
Pursuit of Recognition: Conditions are not yet ripe; with further effort and the assistance of others, one's ideals can be realized.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Complications and even setbacks and changes may arise, but if both parties are filled with confidence, a good outcome will emerge.		
		
Decision-Making: The individual is wise, shrewd, diligent, but neglects interpersonal relationships, combined with the exclusion by antagonistic people, may encounter misfortune. With strong willpower and a fighting spirit, overcoming shortcomings, despite the high costs, one can surely achieve success.
- Scholar Interpretation: Great going and small returning, obstruction and impassability; when misfortune reaches its extreme, prosperity comes, cultivate virtue to avoid calamity. 		
		
Those who receive this hexagram are in a situation where everything is obstructed, there is a lack of harmony between above and below, and nothing proceeds smoothly. In all matters, patience is advisable; you must wait for favorable times for any action. 		
		
Fate and fortune: nothing goes smoothly, do not act recklessly. 		
		
Financial fortune: it is suitable to purchase, profits will be gained later.		
		
Home and dwelling: be diligent and frugal to avoid disaster; there is an indication of separation.

**Here's my question: After going to work, is it possible to get a salary raise?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- The primary hexagram "Progress" indicates potential advancement and favorable conditions, with descriptions emphasizing gaining positions and promotions.
- Line interactions indicate challenges. The "Demons" line signals high pressure and limited growth, while the "Wife and Wealth" line suggests better opportunities with change.
- The transformation lines provide specific imagery about actions and outcomes, indicating the potential benefits of moving or changing the job for better opportunities.
  
### Example 2 Analysis:
- The primary hexagram "Peace" indicates a favorable situation, with imagery focused on harmonious growth and successful endeavors.
- The analysis highlights the "Demons" line generating support, signifying recognition from leaders and potential promotion.
- The "Wife and Wealth" lines becoming static indicate the need for patience despite favorable conditions, implying there is hope for promotional success when the time is right.

### Hexagram Interpretation:

<analyze>
Both examples contain detailed interpretations based on the hexagram's theme and the lines' interactions, particularly how the elements and the six relatives affect the outcome. They focus on the movement of lines and the roles of spirits in determining the potential for change or success. Following this detailed interpretation process, I will now apply the same to your situation based on the hexagram received.
</analyze>

<reason>
For your question regarding the possibility of a salary raise, we have the primary hexagram: "Stagnation (Stanstill)." This hexagram indicates separation, obstruction, and hindrance in advancement, reflecting an adverse phase of decline.

1. **Analysis of the Hexagram:**
   - The hexagram's general attributes emphasize a period of obstacles in communication and growth (Heaven and Earth obstruction). This suggests an unfavorable condition for achieving a salary raise.
   - The overall advice is to remain patient and cautious during this time, suggestive of the need to rely on personal prudence and wait for a more opportune time.

2. **Line Interactions:**
   - Line 1, changing to "Do not act recklessly," suggests focusing on not taking hasty actions or decisions that could lead to mishaps. Here, the line transforming into "Children," which often symbolizes new beginnings or ventures, can be interpreted as an advice to nurture personal growth during stagnation.
   - The "Demons" line in Line 2 suggests possible pressure or adverse conditions affecting your endeavors.
   - Throughout the hexagram, the "Wife and Wealth" represents current wealth/prosperity not aligning well with your position, indicating potential obstacles to financial growth.
 
3. **Interactions of Elements and Spirits:**
   - The elements (metal, wood, earth) and Relations hint at underlying conflicts and reinforce the notion of current limitations with some pressure to keep prudence.
   - The spirit associations with each line indicate the presence of challenges or adversities that require navigating carefully with wisdom.

Given these evaluations, the hexagram indicates that while the current conditions for a salary raise are not favorable due to obstruction and hindrances, patience and cautious planning can eventually offer a clearer path forward as obstructions inevitably ebb away.

</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
Currently, it seems unlikely that you will receive a salary raise due to obstructions and hindrances indicated by the hexagram "Stagnation." This phase points to a time where progress is limited, and challenges may be present. It's wise to demonstrate patience and careful planning during this period. However, remember that this stagnation will not last forever, and better opportunities can arise as circumstances shift. In the meantime, focus on personal growth and improvement, which will prepare you for advancement when the window of opportunity opens.

Standard Answer: Recent improvements are limited, and it is advisable to wait for a good opportunity. Additionally, this hexagram suggests the corresponding lines of the yin and yang and compatibility between mao and xu, indicating benefits in collaborating with others. There may be someone who can help facilitate your development through cooperation. The Parents line is at the yin position, symbolizing others, while the yang represents yourself. The harmony between the two signifies that your collaborator may be an elder or superior, someone beneficial to you. This person could be considered a benefactor; you should definitely accept their cooperation and maintain a good relationship with them. This could lead to positive developments for your future. Overall, this adjustment is promising, moving in a favorable direction, and you should proceed as it might benefit you. Although the favorable results might not be immediately visible, when the water phase becomes prominent, the benefits may become apparent.
