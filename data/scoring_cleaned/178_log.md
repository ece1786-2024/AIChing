## Hexagram Information

## Primary Hexagram: Contemplation

### General Information

- Description: Hexagram Guan: During sacrificial rituals, wine is poured to invite spirits without offering human sacrifices, because the heads of captives used for sacrifice are swollen and cannot be used as offerings. The Xiangci states: In this hexagram, the upper trigram is Xun, which represents wind, and the lower trigram is Kun, which represents earth. The wind moves across the earth, blowing over all things; this is the image of Guan. The ancient kings observed this hexagram image and took the wind that circulates in all directions as a model, thereby patrolling the states, observing the people's conditions, and promoting enlightenment.
- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram is composed of different trigrams stacking, with wind moving on the earth, symbolizing the widespread teaching of virtue. The Observing and the Approaching hexagrams form complementary pairs for mutual use. Those in higher status contemplate the world with morality and justice, while those below look up with reverence, leading to submission of hearts.		
		
The Image: The wind moves above the earth, implying a meaning of traveling and sightseeing. Yin prevails as Yang diminishes, the righteous path weakens, and all things struggle to proceed.		
		
Fortune: Being in the midst of change, it is advisable to observe meticulously, as one may experience distress both mentally and physically, and must guard against external temptations.		
		
Career: Signs of adversity have appeared in one's career, necessitating humility and caution. One should have foresight and avoid short-term actions, remain open-minded, and focus on good interpersonal relationships, uniting with others, and not acting rashly. When necessary, it is not inappropriate to seek assistance from virtuous individuals to seek further development.		
		
Business: The market situation is unstable and in a state of flux, requiring caution and careful observation of trends, planning for the long term, and being prepared for retreat if needed.		
		
Reputation: It is important to have self-knowledge, modestly seek guidance from others, correct one's attitude towards life, and avoid self-satisfaction. Moreover, one must adhere to integrity and establish grand ideals without losing personal goals or deviating from the righteous path.		
		
Marriage and Romance: Unfavorable; both parties should withstand tests, plan for the long term, leading to an ideal outcome.		
		
Decision-making: Possessing organizational ability makes one suitable for responsible work, but life's journey involves many twists. It is crucial to cultivate foresight and observance, handling matters impartially and realistically, paying attention to human dynamics, and caring for others. Especially avoid falling into the paths of petty people or shortsighted behaviors. One should exhibit a resolute spirit, not follow blindly, and if necessary, employ strategic dependency.
- Scholar Interpretation: Observing below while viewing above, traveling and inspecting; maintaining calmness and composure, remain steadfast at your post. One who receives this hexagram finds themselves amidst change, with unsettled mind and spirit. It is advisable to observe keenly, act when the opportunity arises, and refrain from rash advancement. Fu Peirong, a renowned scholar in Taiwanese Sinology, interprets as follows: Fortune: Travel outside; it is not easy to stay idle at home. Wealth: Selling foreign goods, be cautious of risks. Residence: Worship gods and Buddhas. Health: Rheumatic conditions, exercise and nurture.

- Traditional Interpretation: This hexagram consists of the same trigram repeated, with lower Li and upper Li. Li symbolizes attachment, representing the idea of attaching itself, with a single yielding line adhering to two solid lines above and below. The hexagram symbolizes fire, with emptiness inside and brightness outside. Li represents fire and brightness, with the sun rising and setting repeatedly, moving ceaselessly, with gentleness at heart.		
		
Great Image: Two fires overlap, symbolizing being connected from top to bottom with clarity, representing the idea of fire having energy but lacking form, indicating inconstancy and unreliability.		
		
Prospects: Outwardly very prosperous, resembling the sun at its zenith, but it is inadvisable to rush into things or act impulsively.		
		
Career: Approaching the pinnacle, with prosperity reaching decline; it is essential to summarize experiences and lessons, pursue good and avoid evil, nurture oneself with the flow, be aware of dangers while in danger, inspire willpower, and refrain from reckless actions. It is especially important to seek the assistance of people who are upright and strive to revitalize one's career.		
		
Business: Avoid being overly eager for success; proceed with caution, be deeply considerate and far-sighted, study market trends, engage in fair competition, avoid speculation and cunning, and strive for close cooperation with others.		
		
Fame Seeking: Before the direction is determined, do not act rashly in all directions, be persistent, pursue resolutely, and humbly seek guidance from virtuous and talented elders.		
		
Marriage and Romance: It might be difficult to find a suitable partner on your own, so it's best to enlist the help of reliable friends and elders, and do not be impatient. Both parties should respect each other, and it's most important to avoid having improper thoughts.		
		
Decision Making: Be cheerful and accept fate, conform to nature. In youth, rushing for progress might not realize one's ideals; however, by adhering to fairness and humility, one can be without misfortunes, and by remaining alert, can turn danger into safety. In times of crisis, seek support, but be cautious in selecting whom to rely on. In later years, understand one's destiny and avoid rash actions that disregard the situation.

**Here's my question: Will the man's pursuit of his lover succeed?**
    
Hexagram_Interpreter: 
Let's analyze step by step.

<analyze>

**Example 1 Analysis:**

In Example 1, the question pertains to friends fulfilling their promises, and the hexagram received is "Contemplation" (Guan). Starting with the primary hexagram interpretation, it symbolizes observing and comprehensive assessment without hasty actions. The primary focus is on observing changes and potential difficulties in the environment.

Then each line is analyzed for its elemental relations and spirits. For example:
- The second line relates to "Demons" and is the self line, indicating internal challenges or illusions.
- The response line—related to change—supports the self line, suggesting a need for calmness and patience.
Through the interactions of the changed and unchanged lines, particularly focusing on Sibling and Parent interactions, the overall interpretation concludes that friends may face objective difficulties in fulfilling promises, indicating external factors challenging the commitments.

**Example 2 Analysis:**

In Example 2, concerning the research project's completion, the "Clinging Fire" (Li) hexagram is involved. The hexagram speaks to clarity, insight, and growth potential though caution is required against impulsiveness.

Key aspects like the presence of strong and active Children lines contribute positively, suggesting a strong foundation. It is important that the self remains focused and supported (as suggested by the supporting line drawn by favorable elemental interactions with the day's influence).

Through the auxiliary analysis and element relationship, positive line attributes are emphasized, suggesting the project should yield success with concentrated effort.

</analyze>

Now, applying this method to your provided information:

<reason>

**Hexagram for Query: Will the man's pursuit of his lover succeed?**

**Primary Hexagram: The Creative (Qian)** 

- **General Interpretation**: "The Creative" indicates robust strength, persistence, good fortune, symbolizing advancement if pursued with vigor. Success is in the air as it embodies pure yang energy suggesting prosperity.

- **Elemental and Relational Analysis**: 
  - Line 4, which changes, indicating a temporal adjustment or retreat, is significant. Ren wu fire (Demons) turns into a yin line, suggestive of challenge or warning to remain alert and cautious of excess enthusiasm.
  - Line 5 (Sibling relation with Hook Snake spirit) implies engaging with social elements and possibly indicates support from respected individuals that may help align his pursuits, but also speaks to maintaining harmony and observing risks of over-exertion.
  
To apply this understanding effectively to your question, the man's pursuit aligns with the symbolism of "The Creative" as long as restraint is practiced. Elements are favorable but caution against excess and potential transitions (or changing dynamics) is suggested to navigate the romantic pursuit to a harmonious state. The relational dialogue suggests reaching out and networking, subtly leveraging social ties.

Ultimately, the pursuit has an auspicious groundwork according to the principles meeting prospects for connection and harmony if appropriately balanced from overextension or overt eagerness.

</reason>
Rational_Agent: 
The pursuit of his lover is likely to succeed, as the hexagram "The Creative" suggests robust strength and good fortune. However, it is crucial to maintain balance and avoid excessive actions or displays of eagerness, which could disrupt harmony. The man should also consider engaging socially and seeking support from respected individuals to help guide his pursuit in a positive direction. If he focuses on these aspects, his romantic pursuit may lead to a successful and harmonious outcome.
