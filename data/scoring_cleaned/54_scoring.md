1. **Break down the standard answer into key points and assign a score:**

   - The father got cold: 2 points
   - Recovered relatively quickly: 6 points

2. **Evaluate the generated answer:**

   - **Relevance (2 points):** This answer is about health and recovery though it diverges toward general advice rather than focusing specifically on recovering from a cold. Given the general relevance to recovery and health, I would allocate a partial point here. 

   - **Key points coverage:**

     - The father got cold: The generated answer does not mention a cold. 0 points.
     - Recovered relatively quickly: The generated answer does not explicitly state that recovery was quick but suggests a natural and favorable progress which aligns with natural recovery. I'll allocate 2 out of 6 points for the emphasis on natural recovery and favorable course.

   Detailed explanations aligned with bullet points for evaluation:

   - **The father got cold (Full Score: 2):** This specific symptom is crucial as it sets the context for the quick recovery mentioned later. The generated answer does not specifically mention a cold; hence, it did not earn any points here.

   - **Recovered relatively quickly (Full Score: 6):** The essence of the standard answer lies in the rapid recovery. Although the generated answer doesn't specify speed, it does mention favorable and natural progress, slightly suggesting non-urgent treatment, so it indirectly supports a notion of recovery. Therefore, I assigned 2 points here for a subtle inference.
