0	丢失的失物（口琴）能找回吗？	Can the lost item (a harmonica) be recovered?	戊戌年壬戌月庚寅日	2018-10-20T15:00:00Z	离火在下，艮山在上。离火为文明之象，也可以象征为文艺，与口琴之物吻合。应爻戌为火库，卯戌世应亦是六合火局。唯上卦其象艮为山，则压伏离火之光明，犹如光明被山峰遮挡，文明不显。幸亏山为静物，乃不动之物。见遮挡其光明的并非来往小孩，因小孩为动者。此物又为家中遗失，未动则未能远离。离火之光明与艮峰之循环往复，此象很像家中抽屉，因其循环抽动则有往复之象。世应之合被月冲破，逢月破相伤，事与愿违。幸亏是寻找物体，待酉月过后，月破反化六合，则是吉兆。	物品可能遗失在室内偏隐位置，需家人帮忙方可找回，另可能需等待时机。	The lost item may be in a hidden spot indoors and requires help from family members to find it. Alternatively, waiting for the right time may also be necessary.	Li Fire is below, Gen Mountain is above. Li Fire symbolizes civilization and can also represent the arts, aligning with objects like the harmonica. The responding line, Xu, is the storehouse of fire, and the interaction of Mao and Xu forms a hexagram of a harmonious fire circle. However, the upper trigram, Gen, represents a mountain, which suppresses the brightness of the Li Fire, akin to the light being obscured by a peak, causing civilization to be unmanifested. Fortunately, the mountain is a static entity, immobile. The obstruction to its brightness is not caused by children, as children are movers. This entity is again a lost item in the house; being immobile, it has not drifted far away. The cyclic nature of Li Fire's brightness and Gen Mountain is reminiscent of a drawer at home, as its repetitive motion mimics cycles. The conjunction of the subject and object is disrupted by the moon, and when the month breaks, it leads to injuries, and things deviate from desires. Fortunately, since it’s about searching for an object, after the You month passes, the broken month turns back into a hexagram of harmony, which is an auspicious sign.	22	37	geng
1	流年财运如何？	How will the financial fortune be this year?	丁亥年戊申月巳申日	2007-08-15T17:00:00Z	求财应以子水妻财为用神。此卦为子孙申金持世，妻财正好为应爻，世应分居卦之青龙朱雀，位居六爻之上下两位，并成申子半合之势，占据了该卦的所有重要位置。兄弟爻为忌神；虽动，但化退，且余力与世应构成申子辰三合财库，是化忌为用之象，预兆为所测之事皆逢凶化吉。同时，卦于日月劫财过旺，天时尤为不利；但变卦却又遇六合，妙在变卦六合巳申化水却也恰为妻财。又一得六合财之象。同时，卦变六合大多也是遇难成祥之象。	此卦的明显之处，强大的信息量告诉我们，无论是申子辰还是巳申；皆是化为水，水为本卦之财；正为命主所问之事，其气象具足，所以主卦和变卦都脱离不了财源兴旺的结果。正所谓用神兴旺，忌神无力。财气具足，求财得力。得到这种卦，必大利流年财运。求财虽非大富，但能稳步小积。建议控制开支，耐心等待更好财运到来。	This hexagram indicates strong and abundant information, showing that the transformations align with the querent's question. The imagery is sufficient, and both the primary and transforming hexagrams point to thriving financial resources. The favorable elements are strong, while the opposing elements are weak. The financial prospects are abundant, and wealth acquisition is effective. Receiving this hexagram suggests favorable financial fortune for the year. While it may not lead to great wealth, steady and gradual accumulation is possible. It is advised to control spending and patiently wait for better financial opportunities.	To seek wealth, the Water element associated with the Wife/Fortune line should be used. This hexagram is represented by the Grandchild's Metal element signifying the Subject, while the Wife/Fortune line perfectly aligns with the Correspondent line. The positions of the Subject and Correspondent are found in the hexagram's Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird, located at the upper and lower positions of the six lines, respectively, and form a partial union of Shen and Zi. They occupy all the critical positions in the hexagram. The Brother line is an unfavorable element; although it is active, it transforms into retreat, and its residual energy forms a triad union with Shen, Zi, and Chen to create a treasury for wealth, symbolizing transformation from adversity to utility, predicting that the matter inquired will turn misfortune into fortune. Meanwhile, excessively strong robbery of wealth is high during the day and month, which is particularly unfavorable for timing; however, the changing hexagram encounters the Union of Six, fortuitously and transforms the Union of Six Si and Shen into Water, which appropriately represents the Wife/Fortune line. There is another symbol of gaining the Six Union's fortune. Additionally, the transition to the Union of Six in hexagrams often also signifies turning danger into safety.	5	48	si
2	蓝翔技校是真的牛逼吗？	Is Lanxiang Technical School really that impressive?	甲午年癸酉月己酉日	2014-10-05T19:00:00Z	世爻亥水动而冲应爻巳火，卦中金气生助世爻，六合金局稳固，整体趋势较吉，唯有小挫折。	整体环境支持学员发展，但需适应激烈竞争。	The overall environment supports personal development, but one must adapt to intense competition.	The moving line in the position of the world corresponds with the water of the Hai clashes with the responding line of the Si fire. Within the hexagram, the metal element fosters and assists the line of the world, while the Six Harmonies metal configuration remains stable. The overall trend is quite auspicious, with only minor setbacks.	15	37	ji
3	工作去了后能否提升工资？	Will my family be stable and smooth after I leave?	戊子年丁巳月癸亥日	2008-05-23T15:00:00Z	因为测问工作去了后能否提升工资，是为测财运，所以取 3爻妻财卯木为用，用神妻财卯木持世，卯木随虽动本应吉，但可惜卯化出申金劫财回头克世，世矛木财星又逢日冲破，事损克，在月亦处于泻气之地，所以财爻用神不旺，偏弱，持世主有财，能求到财，但是化兄弟克劫主求不了大财，所的之财为比较辛苦所得。其用爻卯木内卦上爻《第三爻》为动爻，主事情发展快，吉凶易见且应验迅速，财动有动之象，不见源财难旺，除非水木来临，而在今年水木之月要等到冬季，夏秋一般，到了今年冬季利财。白虎临财爻用神爻发动，白虎发动主刑伤，官司疾病不利，财虽然临世为喜用，但是可惜又化回头克和日冲劫，所以求工资难涨。其求财的原神子孙爻未上卦，做事少人帮，须靠自己的力量，也表示事物的发展缺乏原动力。忌神兄弟比较旺，劫财强于财星，所以求财辛苦，财不大，但是兄弟不动，亦不至于有什么大破财之忧，但是要注意下农历7月份和农历8月份，今年的农历七，八两个月为庚申，辛酉纯金之运，在这两个月要注意可能有为不必要的事情而花消大，是劫财临旺之月，因为。在农历PN月份和PP月份财运比较不错。求财财神不旺，兄弟劫财也不动，逢月克也不够旺，所以总体来看，不会破财，但是也发不了大财。想求涨工资估计在本月财泻气之月无望，下个月财爻临合在财旺之日亦有希望，但是被兄弟通关亦难涨工资，在农历7月8月和9月希望都不大，估计至少要到今年冬天农历PN月和PP月财神源头水来生卯木财星之时比较有希望。其但是求财的原神子孙爻未上卦，做事少人帮，须靠自己的力量，也表示事物的发展缺乏原动力。不过其忌神兄弟亦偏弱，亦主所测事物遇外部阻力甚少，事情进展较为顺利。综合起来看就是个少阻力，也少人帮的局势，没有人帮求财难，没有阻力也难破财。此卦为平卦偏上，要求财，待到冬季来。	近期提升有限，等待良机为宜。另外此卦应爻和世爻卯戌相合，主利于与他人合作办事，可能有人与你合作事情能促进自身的发展，父母爻临应，应主他人，世主你自己，世应相合，主与你合作者是属于长辈或是上司等，这人对你是有利的，算的上贵人，一定要接受他的合作，并且与他保持良好的关系，对你的将来可能会有好的发展，所以总体来说你这次调动算是好的，是向着吉利的方向发展的，你尽量要去，这也许对你有利，只是暂时不一定看的到吉利的后果，但是以后等到水旺之时也许就会看到了。	This is a favorable hexagram. It turns misfortune into fortune, with external challenges but internal auspiciousness. There is no need for unnecessary worry.	"Because the inquiry was about whether a salary raise can be achieved, it is considered a financial divination. Therefore, the third line, Wife Wealth Wood, is used as the significant line. The significant line of Wife Wealth Wood stands as the current aspect. While Wood moving generally suggests fortune, unfortunately, the change from Wood to Metal signifies a loss as it counters the significant line. The wealth star is also shattered by daily opposition, causing harm. During this month, it is also in a weakened position, so the financial line is not strong, rather weak. Although it holds prominence suggesting wealth is obtainable, it indicates hard-earned small wealth due to competition. The Wood line in the third position is active, suggesting rapid development, with quick and clear outcomes—financial movement signifies activity. Without the source wealth, flourishing is unlikely unless water and wood appear, which would happen in the winter months of this year. For summer and autumn, it is average, but during the winter of this year, prosperity in financial matters is expected.

The presence of the White Tiger with the financial and significant lines indicates movement. The White Tiger denotes punishment, legal issues, and illness, which is detrimental. Although wealth is present, it is regrettably countered by opposing forces and daily breaks, making salary increases difficult. The original spirit line of Offspring is not present, indicating little support from others and reliance on one's own efforts, further indicating a lack of initial momentum in tasks. The rival brothers are relatively strong, meaning wealth competition surpasses the wealth star, indicating hard-earned wealth. However, since the brothers are not moving, there is no great concern over losing major wealth. However, attention should be paid in the lunar months of July and August, during the Metal influence, which suggests unnecessary expenses due to strong wealth rivalry. In lunar months PN and PP, financial luck is relatively good. Though the Wealth divinity is not strong and rival wealth is not active, coupled with insufficient monthly impact, financial ruin is unlikely, but neither is substantial wealth. Expectation for a salary raise this month during the weakening of wealth is unlikely; next month, a possible favorable alignment for salary raise occurs when wealth aligns on a day when wealth is strong, but intervention by rivals makes the raise challenging. The hope is slim in July, August, and September, likely requiring until winter in lunar months PN and PP when Water nourishes the Wealth Wood star. Although help is scarce with original spirit lines absent, external resistance is limited, and tasks proceed smoothly.

Overall, it is a scenario with neither much resistance nor much help, making earning wealth challenging without assistance, but also lessening risk of loss due to absence of resistance. It is a neutral divination leaning slightly positive, suggesting financial pursuit awaits until winter."	12	25	gui
4	测升学	Will my salary increase after starting the new job?	丁亥年丙午月庚辰日	2007-06-15T03:00:00Z	"求功名首用父官两神，卦中官星不现，初爻父临日破，官父两神皆不得力；上爻父母虽动，又化财回头冲克之，父母虽动却临日破加化回头克，父母爻亦非常衰弱；用神无力且受损严重，卦象已有不吉。当大象不吉已成，看世爻有无补救；本卦世爻为兄弟持世，测升学考试兄弟爻持世乃本是不吉之象，盖兄弟代表同学，而持世即代表同学处于旺地，引申出竞争力必强盛，所以兄弟持世不利升学；再者兄弟乃泻父母之神，本卦父母爻临兄弟爻两爻皆动；兄弟使得已被化回头克和日破的父母爻再度泄气，故又能使父母爻更衰；用神更虚弱。
再看世应爻组合关系：兄弟持世生子孙应爻，子孙乃克官鬼之神，卦中无财星通关，如同四柱八字中伤官旺而无财一样，卦中结构忌见官星；而本卦测主所求测之事恰用神用官用印，而卦中官印又衰绝而伤官反旺故忌见官，用神一旦成忌神，格局破败无疑。
看卦象：卦逢反吟，凶多吉少。本卦最重要的两个爻：用神爻父母被化回头克即反吟；而世爻又化回头克即再逢反吟；实升学之事自然越顺畅越好，最怕夜长梦多，而反吟重重，本应是坎坷之象，再加上两最重要的核心爻神化反吟回头克，更是凶多吉少的象征。
看六神：青龙吉神虽临父母爻本应是吉，但是其恰恰不动又被日破而无力；兄弟凶神临世爻且动又临白虎位，主他人同学得势，自己不利。
既是升学，那么不妨也来看下与升学有关的最重要的神煞：甲木日文昌文曲在于巳酉；文昌星持世却被回头克又临兄弟，当日文昌在同学头上高照，对自己都不利。"	通过以上六点已知此卦求升学之艰难，如同涣散之师而求胜仗，难矣！学业进取道阻且长，唯有大力拼搏方可望顶。	Recent opportunities for promotion are limited, and waiting for the right moment is recommended. Additionally, the hexagram shows a favorable interaction between the external factor and the self, suggesting benefits from collaborating with others. It indicates that a collaborator, possibly a senior or superior, may assist in personal growth. This person can be considered a benefactor. Maintaining a good relationship with this collaborator is crucial, as it may lead to positive outcomes in the future, though such benefits might not be immediately visible. Over time, when conditions improve, the results may become apparent.	"To seek fame and position, one begins with the two spirits of father and official. If the official star does not appear in the hexagram, and the first line father suffers a daily break, then both spirits are ineffective. The upper line parents may be active, but they transform into wealth, causing conflict and suppression, resulting in the parents, though active, being weakened by the daily break and further damaged by transformation. The use spirit is weak and gravely damaged, indicating the hexagram is already unfavorable. When the overall image shows misfortune, examine the host line for any remedies. In the primary hexagram, the host line is held by brothers, which is inauspicious for exams. This is because brothers represent peers and competition is strong when brothers are in a thriving position, thus making it disadvantageous for exams. Furthermore, the brothers drain the parents’ spirit, with both parents’ lines in motion due to the brothers' influence. The brothers further drain the already disrupted and weakened parents, increasing their weakness, leading to an even weaker use spirit.

Next, observe the relationship between the host and the responder lines: brothers holding the host give birth to the offspring responder line, which clashes with the official ghost spirit. There is no finance star to bridge the gap, similar to a strong injury official without wealth in the four pillars Bazi, making the hexagram structure unfavorable for seeing the official star. The subject's inquiry involves the use of spirit, official, and seal, yet the official and seal in the hexagram are weak while the injury official is strong, making it undesirable to see the official. When the spirit becomes a taboo spirit, the pattern inevitably fails.

Examining the hexagram imagery: the hexagram encounters a reversed chant, indicating more misfortune than fortune. In this primary hexagram, the two most crucial lines— the parents’ spirit line transforms into a reversed chant caused by conflict, and the host line further transforms into a reversed chant. In the context of exams, smooth progress is desired, whereas an abundance of dreams signifies challenges. The repeated presence of reversed chants, with the two most vital core spirit lines being disrupted, spells more misfortune than fortune.

Regarding the Six Spirits: Although the auspicious Azure Dragon governs the parents’ line, suggesting fortune, it is inactive and suffers a daily break, rendering it powerless. The brothers’ ominous spirit governs the host line, is in motion, and occupies the White Tiger position, indicating that peers gain power while disadvantaging oneself.

Since it concerns academic advancement, let's consider the most vital deities associated with studies: Jia Wood Day's Wenchang and Wenqu occupy Si and You. The Wenchang star governs the host but is conflicted again and situated with the brothers. When the Sun Wenchang shines brightly on peers, it becomes disadvantageous to oneself."	59	7	geng
5	男测婚，未婚。	Predict educational advancement.	癸亥年癸亥月甲寅日	1983-11-22T15:00:00Z	父母爻发动，化回头克，婚姻难成。卦象显示父母爻持世，双方意见不统一导致感情破裂。需调整心态，世爻临日辰克，婚事暂缓，待时机成熟方可重启。	世应交互关系不佳，宜调整双方沟通方式，避免矛盾激化。建议专注事业或学业，提高自身价值，等待合适机缘。	The pursuit of higher education appears challenging, akin to an uphill battle. The path of academic advancement is long and difficult, requiring significant effort and determination to achieve success.	When the parental line is activated and transforms to counteract, marriage is difficult to achieve. The hexagram indicates that the parental line dominates, leading to a breakdown in the relationship due to differing opinions between both parties. It is necessary to adjust one's mindset; as the main line is restrained by the day's branch, the marriage should be postponed until the timing is right for resumption.	36	22	jia
6	父子七人被问案如何？	A man asks about marriage (unmarried).	戊子年乙卯月辛亥日	2008-03-12T17:12:02Z	卦中子孙爻不稳，动爻克世爻，显示结局不吉，恐判刑。	六冲卦，世爻临月破，最终判刑三年徒刑。	The interaction between the external factor and the self is poor, suggesting the need to adjust communication methods to avoid escalating conflicts. Focus on career or education to improve personal value while waiting for suitable opportunities.	The line representing descendants within the hexagram is unstable, and the moving line overcomes the subject line, indicating an unfavorable outcome, possibly leading to a sentence.	57	58	xin
7	某女测官司。	A woman asks about a lawsuit.	丁卯年辛丑月癸未日	1987-02-03T03:00:00Z	世爻值日辰克，诉讼对己不利，官爻发动克世爻，主官司对方更占上风。卦象显示世爻有月破，需多准备证据，耐心等待有利时机反击。	此官司当前形势不佳，需做好心理准备，建议搜集更多证据，加强辩护。同时保持冷静，勿激化矛盾。官爻若日后休囚，可尝试调解。	The lawsuit currently faces unfavorable conditions. Mental preparation is necessary. It is advised to gather more evidence and strengthen the defense. Maintain composure and avoid escalating conflicts. If the situation weakens in the future, consider attempting mediation.	When the line representing the self is controlled by the ruling day, litigation is unfavorable to oneself. If the official line moves to overpower the self line, it indicates that the opposing party in the lawsuit is gaining the upper hand. The hexagram shows that the self line is in a monthly break, requiring more preparation of evidence and patiently waiting for a favorable opportunity to counterattack.	44	6	gui
8	到某地如何成功办一摊位？能批准否？	How can I successfully set up a stall at a specific location? Will it be approved?	壬午年甲辰月癸卯日	2002-04-05T05:00:00Z	卦象不利，子孙爻虽发动但受空亡，办理摊位的事情可能受到阻碍。建议做好充分准备，耐心等待合适时机再行动。	子孙爻发动显示此事最终可能成，但当前阻力较大，需灵活应对。建议提前做好资料准备，与相关部门沟通，争取在有利时机提出申请。	The activation of certain elements suggests that setting up a stall is ultimately possible, but there are significant obstacles at present. Flexibility in approach is required. It is recommended to prepare documents in advance, communicate with relevant departments, and apply when the timing is advantageous.	The hexagram is unfavorable, and although the descendants' line is activated, it is voided, so matters concerning setting up stalls may encounter obstacles. It is recommended to make thorough preparations and patiently wait for the right time to act.	3	29	gui
9	求财运分析	Requesting financial fortune analysis.	甲寅年戊辰月甲申日	1974-04-13T07:00:00Z	财爻空亡，受月破克制，求财需以稳为主，避免盲目冒进或投资。卦象显示当前财运较弱，建议守财为宜，暂不宜大规模投入。	卦象建议当前重在积蓄，不宜冒险。若需开展新项目，建议控制风险，耐心等待更好的财运时机。	The hexagram suggests focusing on accumulation at present and avoiding risks. If starting a new project, it is advised to control risks and wait for a more favorable financial opportunity.	The wealth line is void, and subject to disruption and suppression by the month, seeking wealth should focus on stability, avoiding blind risks or investments. The hexagram indicates that the current financial fortune is relatively weak, suggesting that conserving wealth is advisable, and large-scale investments are not suitable at the moment.	22	53	jia
10	男测日运	A man asks about his daily fortune.	辛丑年癸巳月戊申日	1961-05-15T09:00:00Z	世爻值父母爻发动，主当日运势平稳，无大灾大难，但需注意父母爻化克世爻，可能会有小挫折或阻碍。	今日适宜办理事务或出行，整体运势较顺，但仍需注意细节，避免因疏忽而导致意外。	Today is suitable for handling tasks or traveling. The overall fortune is relatively smooth, but attention to details is necessary to avoid unexpected issues due to negligence.	The line representing the current situation is activated by the parent line, indicating that the day's fortunes are stable, without major disasters or difficulties. However, attention is needed as the parent line may transform to counteract the current situation line, potentially causing minor setbacks or obstacles.	25	39	wu
11	测儿子病何日好？	When will my son's illness recover?	辛巳年丁酉月庚寅日	2001-10-08T00:00:00Z	从卦象看，官鬼居金持世，应爻戌土上临西金有力，世爻火弱。测儿子病以申子孙爻为用神，挂中戊戌火为子孙爻，应爻戌土交西金为吉，但不宜子孙爻火受克，说明儿子病稍重。	官鬼金持世，说明为火过旺压制导致，世爻空亡待用。解读的结论表明，约在甲午日后儿子病好转。	"The ""official ghost"" (representing obstacles) holds the dominant position in this hexagram, indicating that excessive fire (overactivity) is suppressing it. The self-line is currently inactive and waiting to be used. The interpretation suggests that the son's illness is likely to improve around the day of Jiawu."	In terms of the hexagram image, the Official Ghost resides with metal and supports the subject, while the response line with Xu earth stands above the western metal with strength, and the subject line fire is weak. When divining about the son's illness, take the Shen child-and-grandson line as the significant line. In the hexagram, Wu Xu fire serves as the child-and-grandson line, and the response line Xu earth interacts positively with the western metal, which is auspicious. However, it is unfavorable that the child-and-grandson line fire is being overcome, indicating the son's illness is somewhat serious.	34	32	geng
12	一妇测其丈夫何日出狱？	A woman asks when her husband will be released from prison.	丁亥年丙子月丙申日	2008-01-08T00:00:00Z	丈夫克世，但丑土为狱之象，官鬼申支持世，卦中有卯未子午辰，必用寅救灾之兆。	此卦说明不急，等待六日，看丙午日有消息。丈夫大概率两日内出狱，或晚上也可能获释。	This hexagram indicates there is no rush. Wait six days; news may arrive on the day of Bingwu. The husband is highly likely to be released from prison within two days, possibly even at night.	A husband overcomes the world, yet the Chou Earth symbolizes imprisonment. The official spirits of Shen support the world. Within the hexagram, there are Mao, Wei, Zi, Wu, and Chen, indicating a sign that must use Yin to avert disaster.	12	23	bing
13	测求财何时得利？	When will I gain financial benefits?	甲戌年丁巳月甲子日	1994-06-07T00:00:00Z	求财以财爻为用，世爻临财卯，世爻合月用财；空文生克间，可得收益，但非丰厚。	主卦求财带辛苦，暗示需关注兄弟持世，避免分争之象。吉利之兆。	"The primary hexagram suggests financial gain will come with hardship. It implies the need to pay attention to the ""brother line"" (indicating potential competition) to avoid disputes. Overall, it is a favorable sign."	To seek wealth, use the wealth line as the function. The active line is associated with wealth and encounters the wealth line in the month; when considered between emptiness and generating-restricting cycles, gains can be obtained, but they will not be abundant.	22	53	jia
14	工程投标能否中标？	Will my project bid be successful?	癸未年乙卯月癸巳日	2003-03-21T16:17:52Z	风泽中孚卦，离火在下，艮山在上。分析以父母交为用神，父母爻主合同、标书，卦中父母休囚，故未中标。	卦象显示无明显财爻生扶，且用神被克冲，难成。	The hexagram shows no evident financial line providing support, and the useful spirit is being suppressed and clashed, making success unlikely.	The Wind and Lake Hexagram speaks of an inner sincerity, with Fire below and Mountain above. The analysis takes the parents as the useful spirit, where the parent line indicates contracts and documents. In the hexagram, the parent line is weak and inactive, hence the contract was not secured.	61	42	gui

The overall situation appears unfavorable in the short term, and adjusting the strategy is recommended.	The line of the world and the day branch are in conflict, indicating that the wealth line is unstable. Management of the pawnshop must be cautious, and it should not operate for an extended period in the short term.	34	21	bing
16	文书是否能顺利办好？	Will the paperwork be successfully completed?	辛丑年丙申月壬寅日	2021-08-22T00:29:53Z	卦中父母交为用神，动临月建生扶世爻，显示文书能顺利完成。	父母爻旺相生世，主文书最终可成，宜早办。	"The ""parent line"" (representing authority or paperwork) is strong and supports the self-line, indicating that the paperwork will eventually succeed. It is advisable to handle it early."	In the hexagram, the parents intersect to serve as the significant spirit, moving to align with the monthly build to support the subject line, indicating that the documents can be completed smoothly.	59	60	ren
17	师生关系能否继续？	Can the teacher-student relationship continue?	丙申年甲午月庚辰日	2016-06-27T20:49:13Z	卦象不利，世爻被克，师生关系有变，最终恐难长久。	师爻生扶不足，世爻日辰受克，关系或将终结。	The teacher line shows insufficient support, and the self-line is suppressed by the current day's energies, suggesting the teacher-student relationship might come to an end.	The hexagram image is unfavorable, the main line is subdued, and the teacher-student relationship changes, ultimately fearing difficulty in lasting.	51	63	geng
